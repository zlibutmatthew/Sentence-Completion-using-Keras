it is todays experience that got hcc
meh  needed parts got attitude
went somewhere else got looked after
he was told it would be about $350
this is incredibly poor workmanship
with this business it is defiantly buyer beware
we will for sure use him again
thanks eric!
always ready to help us whenever we are in town
knowledgeable  honest and shows up when he says
eric is the man to call
james & carrie cameron
i looked here on yelp for a rv store
thanks again eric
joe & maggie
call him  you will  be glad you did !
his local network is vast too
awesome guy to work with  and competitive fees!
i would give eric 6 stars if that was an option
his prices were very fair and reasonable
he called the warranty company for coverage
it would work for a while and then quit again
480-207-8999
eric came recommended to us by another rv owner
she said he was the best
she  right
highly recommended
eric is one of the best
he knows the business of rv repair
he is very experienced in rv repair
my first call to him sold me
i could tell he knew his business
when i need a repair  he is the one i will call
very clean and well-maintained koa
the staff is very friendly bilingual
we are on an adventure of the year
a little comfort a long ways away
the showers were clean and the staff friendly
all in all a very nice experience
there was a bit of traffic in the early am
stayed for 4 days and 3 nights in july 2016
nice pool and playground area if you bring kids
also very easy access to montreal
only reason a 4 and not 5 was the very weak wifi
we were only there for one night
so really ca not  judge it
just not one we will  be coming back too
the park was clean  quiet  and well maintained
highly recommend
this is a classic koa campground
koa is in the business of serving travellers
back to the front i called the number
i had to drive another hour to find a decent hotel
koa is a giant money grab  and this just proves it
give it a pass
in fact  give camping in quebec as pass entirely
it  a nice stop
i would  come again
nice campground with plenty of spaces
big rig friendly
lots of activities
nice folks and not too far from town
the laundry was also clean and open 24 hours
i stayed in cabin #1
you might want to avoid that one
there was a short in the wall socket
the pool was nice too
staff was friendly
we love great customer service :-)
great place for my stuff
emma and joe really know what is  going on there
all in all  i ca not  complain
it is normally way worse
emma and the staff are super nice
this is a better place since dave left
keep up the good job
all these add on fees are ridiculous
dishonest if you ask me
renter beware
this place is shady
save your money & find a more reputable business
8-28-14 thru 9-1-14
bummer right
i called him back
went to voice mail
he texted back he was in a meeting
none are available anywhere
thanks for nothing rvphx
yep thats right no heat
all my food went bad and the battery was dead
and get this
we have had two good experiences renting
we have rented a travel trailer and an rv
everything worked great  no problems whatsoever
we were so grateful for their honesty
we would definitely rent again
every trailer has been clean and well maintained
there website is so easy to find a trailer
i love all the pictures and details provided
rvphx was a great experience
buyer beware! shady business
keep looking for someone else
rent from someone else!
water tank would not  hold water
i have used rv phx multiple times
great variety of trailers to choose from
easy and convenient pick up and drop off
he told me to drive it from phoenix
do not rent from this place!
everything went as it should have
rv was a lot smaller than we thought it would be
we had a horrible experience
he collected over 2 000 without one receipt
again  no documentation
this is a hole in the wall operation
not recommended!
i did not  hear from him all weekend
however  we didnt have any trouble at all
i have used rv phx multiple times
great variety of trailers to choose from
easy and convenient pick up and drop off
great service  communication  and rv
however  please do not  waste my time
i can respect that
what happened today
not only do i not respect it
i put my hand to the keyboard and i yelp about it
regards mb
"we settled on the ""imagine"" from grand design"
a huge thanks to derek yamamoto in sales
shout out to george for our walk through also
great team @ blue dog las vegas
thanks from our family to yours!!
like all things mechanical  issues will arise
5+pete & cheryl d
please read before considering this place
this was the worst sales experience of my life
do not even look at this place please!
we bought a new 5th wheel toy hauler from them
grey tank and black tank labels were mislabeled
a or c did not  work
screws popped out all over the place
sounded very unorganized and disheveled
i am a travel nurse and live full time in my rv
we found the rig we wanted
we went through the process and bought it
terrible terrible service
will never buy there or recommend them
i would give 0 stars but that  not an option
so glad we found them!!
went in december 31st to the las vegas showroom
now to financing
over 120 months of financing  that   $5000
00 more than we expected
she introduced us to nelson
nelson was outstanding
i stood for about 30 seconds more and walked away
"he would  ""never seen that before"
he  the best
thanks nelson and tim
top notch service and professional sales
we wanted the ramp to also serve as a party deck
they have never responded to us
well guess what i am back
what a nightmare
this place is a nightmare
thanks from tim and veronica shirlock
well here we are again
they replaced our new trailer for another lemon
we set everything out and connected everything
really???we are camping
they would not help us out at all
we should have shopped around more
take my advice  shop around
not real happy again as this is horrific!!
its a truly awesome experience
thank you all so much!!!! :)
thank you nelson!!
totally opposite of my service at camping world
unimpressed with yet another rv service center
only one repair was covered
they still know nothing
they say it  a warranty issue
i will never refer them to anyone  ever!
the service department do not  know a thing
dropped off w no problems
that service department tho
i went there today to buy a trailer  we found one
here  the bad part
avoid this place
go somewhere else
i highly recommend blue dog rv
"""big mistake"""
be very afraid!
i was only going down there to look
keep up the good work!charlie shoemaker
great place  and great people to work with!
horrible experience from start to finish
he was awful
just a shitty experience from the start
we had a very nice salesman  jerry
he showed us a travel trailer that was on sale
we verified the price and moved forward
""" back to looking"
we scheduled for may 16th  2018 at 9:00am
when we asked the receptionist she went to check
i asked when  and they could not answer
so here is my problem
they did nothing
we continue the walkthrough
there is water coming out of the outside shower
we did not  ask  they offered
mr michael gilsdorf was a pleasure to deal with
these rv  are suppose to have a lifetime warranty
well guess what again ????
this place is a joke
my trailer is a lemon and it will be replaced
what a nightmare and what a shame
but by the looks of it they really do not  care
"gives new meaning to ""used car salesman"" tactics"
this had to be one of the worst experiences
got there and the front was damaged
ok  that can get fixed
it was time to bring in the slides
30 minutes later
they offer lunch
we left and drove home to so cal the same day
exhausted and pissed
here is a tip blue dog
not pissed and frustrated
overpriced junk
new campers with roof leaks and warped flooring
do not  waste your time
oo up front  then ran off with the money
00  that they had spent the rest
tuesday came and went
no contact from mark or the big guy from idaho
no fridge
no money back
this should never have happened
it is between blue dog  vegas
and the rip off artist they contracted with
blue dogs handling of this has been horrendous
turns out that was incorrect
not happy with it we were still willing to do it
they became upset and said that was too long
no one did and i tried to call but no answer
he then said he would call back and hung up
please go to johnny walker rv and ask for steve
our agent  tyler  was very helpful
we were  left us on our own
our rv registration was expired
this purchase is our 4th rv
so we have a basis for comparison
however  the repair price was outrageous
not sure we will use them again if needed
the manager made a difference
extensive damage to body
i spoke with them a few times  still nothing
they really did not want to do this
almost for 2 months
new heater  simple fix
all done in great fashion
00 which is a good thing but not if job is bad
not buffed out all over
job done in hurry
and not in professional manner
not worth price paid
should get money back for this part of work
i will  definitely go back to him again
i would recommend them to anyone that asked
until i opened the doors
amazing job
in the end all turned out well
once again  thank you carl  kyle and cindy
no stars! premier coach picked up my car
novenber 17 2015
today january 7th 2016
it might ready tomorrow
after doing all the body work and paint
per manager can only do $100
ok i will take it
i have  been renting my own car
at $24 per day on a disability income
per cindy in management @ premier coach
she was going to make sure i was a happy customer
something i was told by pc would be done
i am  not done yet
then again
neither is my car
"""maybe"" tomorrow"
to be continued
highly recommend them!
first  the good news
the car was detailed very well
now  the bad news
fix auto said the repair would take 3 days
i got my car worked on here a few days ago
it was recommend by a friend of mine
jeremy was the man who helped me
jeremy  and the rest of the team were great
my husband and i were very satisfied
would highly recommend this company
great shop!
amazing service
40 bucks later i was good to go
fast  reasonable service
overall excellent experience!
these guys are the best i have ever dealt with
thanks you guys!!
he was able to do it and saved me so much money
highly recommended!
i will  take it
i definitely should have paid attention to that
we went back in and talked with her
she showed us two models
we ran the numbers on the more expensive one
dustin the finance manager was an absolute wizard
fresh off the truck
had problems with it from day 1
firstly the sales experience was a breeze
we knew what we wanted
"jwrv boast about their ""free schooling"""
it  a load of bull
you get a 5m walk through and like i said
i recommend purchasing used  from anywhere else
everyone we worked with at  johnnie were great
5 weeks at least
i would give them 5 stars on that alone
they really helped us
we had plenty of room for our 38' 5th wheel
we stayed here for a couple of days
that was enough
owner is very nice but it is a very small lot
we wo not  go back but you get what you pay for
we stayed here for a couple of days
that was enough
owner is very nice but it is a very small lot
we wo not  go back but you get what you pay for
we stayed here 42 days
lots of issues from this company
but he did not
he was so polite and no-nonsense
cannot recommend enough
having these guys come to your door is a gift
a+++++ all the way!!!
i am completely humbled and grateful
also left a mess on the ground with oil
be prepared to pay
busted knuckle was awesome
they were fast and went above and beyond
great mechanic
you cannot go wrong with him!
really nice guy
thanks john

we then get down to making the payment
"i ask how much and he says ""$260"
that  right
$260 for an oil change and tire rotation

i would  highly recommend him anytime
you will get the price straight up no hidden bull
thanks for the power steering repair
toyota celica 93
on thursday my car died
i was unable to find anyone who could help
out of desperation i called busted knuckle
i am a senior on very limited income
his advice saved me over $200
thank you  john
so it was a total misunderstanding at first
john came thru and really took care of my truck
he went above and beyond
seriously
he really made me a believer in his services
i would recommend him to any one i know
dont do anything without calling him first
well worth the money and time
thanks john
appreciate everything
thanks john
first the jaws on hitch would not release
so glad i did!!! amazing amazing amazing
best decision of the entire trip
you will not be disappointed
trust these guys
they wo not  let you down
thanks again
i told him the fuel pump was bad  and he agreed
his total labor time was 3
i would use them again
thanks soooo much!
well i pull up  and he  parked next to me
thanks  man!
tyler immediately answered his phone at 6
20am and arrived in 25 minutes
a little backstory
aaa was supposed to have someone for us by 6
15am but they called at 6
never return phone calls
even when they say they will
horrible customer service
i am disappointed with the service
now i am  disappointed in a whole lot more
found busted knuckles and called
i found busted knuckle through yelp
until i read the reviews
he  very friendly and he knows what he  doing
highly recommend to everyone
no  these reviews are not  sponsored
they are definitely deserved
this is an awesome business
if we could give him more than 5 stars we would
i highly recommend  john
no surprises or add ons
trustworthy and reliable
knows his stuff
prices are extremely reasonable
thank you john!
these guys are great
fast  courteous and knowlaedgble
however  the problem continued
said the whole unit needed to be replaced
came by today to collect for his service call
i was shocked at the service call price
especially when they did nothing for me
00 including the breakers
in and out 90 minutes
works perfectly
thanks again!
also fixed some wiring issues i was having
great work
great rates
could not  ask for better service
john was very friendly and polite on the phone
he agreed to inspect the car the very next day
really professional  really knowledgeable
john did excellent  timely work at a fair price
i am  not sure how john missed that one but okay
i had my car towed to my house
unfortunately  the part was out of stock
he showed up in about 20 min
seriously
i mean a lot of scary reviews
you could be happy too
if you call busted knuckle
john and his partner are top notch mechanics
it would not start and it could not be jumped
i found busted knuckle on yelp and called
they came out right away
it was my son
john was awesome
i will pay for quality every time
i highly suggest using these guys
i will definitely consider them in the future
i had a great experience
my car died
great pricing for servicing a vehicle
he was very personable and friendly
john is extremely personable and knowledgeable
100% recommended
based on the yelp reviews  i called john
highly recommended!
what can i say?! they saved us
i highly recommend john with busted knuckle
i called and made an appointment
he was very thorough
they do it all!
let it be known
they charge $150 per hour and $100 just to show up
as soon as you meet
you are  at $250
communication was excellent
john is competent in spades
price was more than fair
do not  look anywhere else
second experience with them  not as good as first
had a water leak in our rv
tyler came out instead of john
jeans were filthy  hands were almost black
highly recommend busted knuckle
i was in a dilemma with my fuel pump
thank you guys for doing awesome work!!!
the overall campground is decent  nothing special
the site is very reasonably priced
simple  clean and primitive site
the wi-fi did not  work so we used our hot spot
we met some very nice people and enjoyed our stay
it was quiet and the location is not  bad
the service is incredibly rude and unprofessional
avoid at all costs!!!
nice staff
not a lot of trees or anything but concrete
spaces pretty darn close together
ok pool area with small hot tub
public bathrooms and showers clean
ditto the laundry room
wifi was really hit or miss
and that  with a booster!  pretty basic place
the motel 6 of rv parks
in fact  there were several vacant spaces
it just left a bad taste in my mouth
the front office is the problem
great park for spring training
employees were fast and friendly
park was clean and quiet
i do not  see what the issue is
her park needed some work anyway
the park is clean and safe
i felt like she just did not  want us to stay
it  a shame she is doing this
the facilities were clean and well-maintained
i liked it  well for the most part
it was quiet clean friendly
my only problem
tempe seems to be turning into a getto
the sites were wide and deep
lived at apache palms for many years
angie and barb   are very rude and unhelpful
you cannot get a site for $236 in the summer
lots of dishonesty among the staff  so be wary
others sleep in remote corners of the park
customers
good luck and happiness in your travels
this park is not a real good place to stay
the pool is a joke and the wifi is nonexistent
there reservation policy is also inflexible
could not  take a walk
not at all what we expected for arizona
absolutely no comparison
staying here is a rip-off
tempe is a mecca of rv'ing
right in front of me!  made me laugh
i was charged additionally for each of my 2 dogs
the wifi stinks  useless really
the surrounding area is not the best part of town
some rough looking young people
i was there 1 night
wo not  be back
their website is deceiving!!!
add me to the crowd
this place sucks
very private
apache palms is a dated but well maintained park
there is no dog run  grass  or club house
the spaces are gravel with narrow cement pads
the wifi worked only enough to keep you trying
""" ?  well  this is not  one of them"
here are some examples of those burrs
we stopped here for two nights
the spaces are tight but the folks were nice
that  nice
we would stay there again for sure
5 starsthis is my second visit
amenities are minimal
wifi is advertised but does not  work
this place is really great for the price
wifi is non existent
they have 4 routers and non of them ever work
so do not  plan on using it
afternoon sun is the devil
woman who answers the phone having a bad life
asked me what my service animal was for
stay at your own risk!
she said large dogs are no longer welcome
no charge!!!!!
and get this
i recommend these guys wholeheartedly
the before or after pictures are amazing
i highly recommend rv renovators
i talked to them two days ago
took our motorhome there for some updating
we had them repair the refrigerator
they had our rv for 2 months
just kept saying they would get to it
there was trash spread around on the furniture
after trying to convince us they did not  do it
anyways  we wo not  be taking our rig back there
i wo not  bring my rv anywhere else
lets not fool ourselves
like anywhere else they are in it to make money
that  all i want
be honest
be reasonable
might be a good business
sadly never found out
mechanical work has also been good
even when it was not   they would make it right
she said they would make it right
still not fixed
i brought my monaco in for major hail damage
insurance check was 18 000
starting with steam cleaning the interior
have to meet with owners next week
fingers crossed!!
they did not  do anything with the water heater
i will never go back!
liars and cheats who take advantage of people
very good communication
they were still wet and we told mark
thanks guys for your support
well  i was wrong about this guy
germaine as our rv experiences continue
we just ca not  say enough about rv renovators
they are very professional and honest
all employees are happy and work so well together
not even a range of $100 over or under
after-all its what the customer is looking for!
when they tell you a time frame  double it
had our rv for 6 weeks  promised 3 for repairs
insuranceance company was not the delay
some items never ordered
now finding items not finished properly
sheet metal not screwed on
if you need work done in mesa area
find someone else
the workmenship and detail is just jaw dropping
we could not  be happier
thanks to an outstanding team
jim  curtis and monty
thank you so much!
rv renovators is 1st class in service and repair
we are on a 2
5 month motor home tour of the us
they also then had to reprogram the slide for us
their speedy service had us back on the road in 3
5 business days
only wish we had rv renovators near us in mi
as a bonus they even washed our rv
and get this
great place to stay
office staff and managers are super helpful
we would highly recommend staying there
and affordable!
we ended up leaving 4 days earlier than planned
i stayed here 2 months ago
i was very pleased with the place
the price for the week was really affordable
very home feeling atmosphere
will be returning here soon
chame to be treated this way
nice and cheap park
very friendly staff
park is huge with different spots
would recommend!
lord knows  i wish i had not
stericycle  inc
stericycle  inc
and dogs barking 24 or 7 right behind park
and line mariachi music until 10 pm in evenings
better places for your money
rude staff
small tight spaces
really bad neighborhood
not a safe place
staff very unhelpful
there are better places to stay
left after four loud nights
police visited the park often
horrible management from pam
she is extremely rude and snappy at customers
great wifi reception
pam is a great manager and lee keeps it spotless
would highly recommend it for rv'ers
huh?this makes no sense at all to me
i will never  ever go back here
i had an amazing time here
lots of space
very clean bathrooms
great pool and hot tub
very friendly people
i lived at green acres for almost a year
the free wifi doesnt work worth a crap
the manager is a backstabbing witch
trust the other reviews
i say avoid that place like the plague
would i stay there again? absolutely !
donna and bernie
and remember cameras are everywhere
excellent! responsive to my first inquiry
scheduled quickly
showed up on time
did craftman-like work
good choice
anyway the guy that came out   did a great job
i  highly recommend phoenix mobile welding
that  pretty rare
john is an honest  upfront guy
he is friendly and runs a good business
bought our first rv from them
i will buy from them again someday
5-star experience all the way
safety first
buy new tires!!
we also found the prices to be reasonable
he quoted me a great price
one that made it worth driving 1
5 hours   to drop it off
he has a lot of knowledge and is a hands on owner
it was the smoothest purchase i have  ever made
this is convenient to everything
we were here for 2 nights and will be back
park is dirty including bathrooms
they smelled and was out of paper
a waste of money  stay somewhere else
mike and ramona
never again
about the cabin
the curtains in all the rooms were filthy
not up to other thousand trails' standards at all
good job  thousand trails
here  maddi again with a review
which we already knew  and we were going to move
so  i though well  maybe he works for the park
just so you know
had a nice porch area to enjoy morning coffee etc
very nice accommodations
staff is great here and always very helpful
men  bathrooms were clean
the restrooms resemble circa 1960 high school p
bathrooms and showers
the pool is actually very nice  as are the staff
the pool hours are limited  closing at 6pm
my eyes have burned and been watery all day
not sure if the sewer leak is the reason  though
pretty disappointed in this las vegas rv park
not in las vegas
the weather was 110-113
we are towing a 25' trailer  with slide outs
we travel with a german shepherd
the dog run was ok  a little shade and grass
maybe we will came again another time of year
when the pool is fixed
and we can have enough room to open our awning
maybe not
this is just a dirt parking lot
crappy tv  thank goodness we have satellite
no pull thru for big rigs
this one has more amenities listed than most
but its all about location  location  location
lets start with the positives
- nice  clean pool and rec room
buy a thousand trails camping pass
otherwise  the place is way to expensive
-  very tight spaces
think carefully before backing into your space
overall  a good stay
i am going to be fair to this resort
this place is horrible
the showers are laid out really stupid
hello rape
need i say more
now to the cabin
yes  we rented a cabin for 3 days
it was listed as it sleeps 4
the bathroom and bedroom doors had no door knobs
just the holes where they were missing
no privacy! the blinds were broken  burned
i called the check in station to let them know
no one ever came
i wished i had known
there was no wifi
i do not  know if i would stay here again
sadly  we had to part ways with tt
a host lingering problems with the park
we were one of them
due to  tatus'
thank you!
our second time here
last time the place was absolutely packed
now that it  summer it has definitely cleared out
staff is very friendly and helpful
helped us choose a site that has a bit of shade
roads are narrow and a bit tight
open again only to close again for landscaping
no hot water in bathroom for over a month
corporate does not
las vegas just close its pool again
no reason other than corporate said to do so
its 109 here and now pool is closed
cdo not join
now $5 a day for 50 amps
next year a charge for the pool
just wait and see
it  a campground in las vegas
well the good
the pool is open after 2 years
do not stay here no matter what
its finally not an rv resort
they have terrible customer service
do not trust
this star is not  even deserved
our site was gravel & level
its inexpensive if you are a member
the campground is close to boulder station casino
its always excellent
the staff & campers have been friendly to us
the way buying a truck should be
i believe i spoke to jt
i found her right away
we agreed
i was off with a truck i loved
3 hrs all in all with a 1
5 hr trip to mechanic included
was a great experience
i would come here again
it  like having a friend in the business
when u buy used
ur buying used
shits gonna need to be fixed
know that
this is a great truck
with a ton of extras not even advertised
stay clear of this shady business!!!!
i completely agree with the previous 2 reviews
purchased an f250
"add describes a  ""beautiful"" truck"
the typical used car bs
i mean a real expert
inspect during the day and do not  buy on impulse
they are good talkers and cover up kings
where does one start?
"he response was ""i knew about the front end"""
how about never had a leak
then the topic of value of the truck came up
the truck has continued to be offered of ebay
very disappointed
i did not buy a warranty
i had the work done at a shop they recommended
he failed to return my call
he did not like  it and responded right away
no such luck
you are totally right
no competition here
my mistake
pigtail for controller was completely corroded
replaced the controller and pigtail
so at night i did not  notice
air filter and oil filter had over 12k on them
the oil was in terrible shape
i learned a lesson
so perhaps 1 star is not  too fair?
no need to continue with the back and forth
after all
from people they buy parts from
your response is a total lie
the experience has been great from the start
no pressure
kevin and his brothers are an absolute joy
they helped us pick out the perfect one
they would make their mother proud
thanks team!
answered the phone hello like i was bothering her
had to ask if i had the business
called this place to see about an oil change
the lady on the phone was so rude
they had 2 weeks
"they ""re-vacuumed"""
it  been 5 days and no call has been received
what a disappointment
never judge a book by its cover
i put my rv there on consignment
they did a great job
i am a female business owner living in california
contacted auto corral rv via rvt
no call back
good luck gals
just purchased a consigned toy hauler
had great service from the staff
staff could not have been any friendlier
all this when they were short-staffed
a big thanks to their staff!
they showed up on time and did an excellent job
my carpets look like new
thank you for the prompt service
we will recommend you to all of our friends
no pun intended! thank you guys  we are so happy
no problem for this honest dealer
we are your customers for life
i purchased a 5th wheel for auto corral
it was a consigned unit
or better yet go elsewhere
one excuse after another why the delay
lastly make sure you get things as promised
still waiting for them
just remember you have choices where to buy from
choose wisely!
love the lake & game room
showers house is clean and have washer and dryers
awesome place!
mostly permanent residents
as one does at 12am
you know for fun
this is not a cheap campground
no thanks
at least there was good  t-mobile reception
the water is nasty
i am  not even sure if this is potable water
stunk big time of rusty nail
has a nice pond
do not  pass this place up!
highly recommend
the place is not very clean
i would not stay there again
decent campground in this area
sites are large  power is stable
we had 50 amp service
several playgrounds and a game room for the kids
fire pits at each site
did not  use the showers so no comment in these
the interior roads are rock and gravel
bumpy and uneven in places
management and workers were nice and helpful
they do wagon rides on the weekends
not great channels over the air though
site was rock and gravel but pretty level
we even had a wooden patio attached to our site
not s lot of camping options in this area of ohio
camp on!
and it is way overpriced
how can we rectify the situation
at times the tv was drowned out
the resort part is it is rv only  no trailers
i ca not  believe this place is even in business
the noise from i 10 is horrible
we wo not  stay here again
i called about 2:30-3:00 pm for reservation
i never receive a courtesy call
i then sent them a message
they responded back to me 12 hours later
we stayed here for 3 nights and loved it
the concrete pads are level with full hook ups
the grounds were well kept
there  a love  station right around the corner
would definitely stay here again
great sunset views! we camped in our 36' class c
not much of a resort
very disappointed
we wo not  be staying here again
very dependable service
highly recommended!
this is a great las vegas rv dealer
johnnie walker in person on the back lot
99  nearly $100
even camperworld was less at 188
the folks at johnnie walker are the best
highly recommend these folks
that  rare
were there things they could improve upon? sure
that happens with every large purchase
my only suggestion - do your own homework
do not  rely on the internet or people  opinions
kudos to the staff at johnnie walker
we would definitely purchase from you again!
ly or 1bfcvji
this is family owned & operated
thanks again tom!
motorhomes are very complex to say the least
i wish we had gone there first
tom explained everything perfectly
they are the real deal !!!!
i ca not  say enough about the service
you guys rock
thank you
did not give receipt! and held money hostage
unbelievable!! he wore a lot of man jewelry rude
all cause we were mom daughter
we had high hopes for johnnie walker rv
poor service for a $90 000 vehicle
both sales and service here are top notch
i am  ready to upgrade now  but i live in oregon
these folks are deserving of your business
could not  be happier!
jw is the place to go for rvs
great service and tons of options on site
i will be back to jw for any rv needs we have!
$600 to replace one waste tank slide valve
i think that  about $500 too high
i bought my used rv from shawna last year
i thought rving was only for retirement
we absolutely love johnnie walker
this is the place to get an rv or travel trailer
they are honest good people
even if you are  just looking at options
i was not  even acknowledged at other places
my first rv
we also dealt with kurt in the parts department
-parts department is knowledgeable and helpful
you wo not  be disappointed
told me to go to ford and get a replacement
unacceptable!
no pushy salesmen and no hidden costs
great selection and great prices
cutter was a delight to work with
but now i wish i had  gone some  where else
well that  not what happen
i  bought  this rv in april 2015
yes  it was a used  coach
i hope that this under warranty
i just hope it is covered
our part of the  bill was $5400
but they said no
now there  thinking  twice
we will be returning
thank you so much dustin
i went to get some info on used diesel motor homes
i am  going to get my next rv from jim
wow what a nice and knowledgeable guy
not pushy!! thanks jim  see you soon!
we bought a used toy hauler from a private seller
first time out we found a lot of problems with it
i will now buy parts or let them work on my rv
i do not  usually do reviews
they did not  try to b
us  or sell us on something we did not  want
we looked at the ones we really wanted to look at
zack and ryan took care of us
both were great and personable
all our questions were answered
no one complained
clean establishment over all
great people
they fixed my hot water tank
my hat is off to jw
i approved the panel closest to the original one
johnnie walker rv has three locations
a true breath of fresh air
i would recommend them to anyone!
remember there are always 2 sides to every story
i ca not  say enough about jonny walker r
i recommend them highly!
these people are crooks
i would also like to address darcy  comment
from there the issues snowball
the list goes
stay tuned for more
that was very impressive
sincerely patrick forbes  2017 stealth wa 2916
this place is horrible and mismanaged
darcy is a poor excuse for an employee
why would anyone want to do business here??????
we are very happy with our purchase
thanks jwrv!
a very nice and easy to talk to gentlemen
thank you mark
we even got to meet johnnie walker himself
he gave us apples from his tree in utah
i cannot speak highly enough about this shop
i reserved an rv site two months before my arrival
i called saying i will be arriving after 7 pm
i called several times and no one return my calls
do not  go there
the management is awesome
super nice people
a little cautious of electricity issues
faulty ground
people seem a little stretchy but they are not
eddie is very helpful
worse rv park ever
horrible rv park
so not stop here!
boulder boats is the best dealer around
they treat everyone like family
five stars are not  enough
everyone there is amazing and friendly
this company nearly ran my family off the road
we literally had no where to go
what a way to represent your business
courtesous driving goes a long way  now you know
great place to go!!!
from start to finish our experience was amazing
carole k
i just made my very first boat purchase
they know how to treat their customers
such high hopes when i contacted boulder boats
i can say this- brittany in finance was stellar
update: response to dealer response
we did so  per the advice of your finance team
i can say this- brittany in finance was stellar
"i hate to say it  because it  ""boulder booats"""
lucas and stewart
thank you for the amazing customer service
the entire staff was amazing
the sales people were not pushy at all
my wife and i are relatively new to boating
just awesome service!
i authorized the repair
more issues were found  i authorized more repairs
i was told it would be ready tuesday  it was not
i climb up on the trailer and my boat is filthy
i mean literally covered in dirt
great service and great people! thanks so much
we love our boat!!!
we drove 5 hrs to our appointment
and are probably very good at what they do
sales dept
parts dept
i love the boat
bb rocked it for me!!! these guys are awesome
great go the extra mile for customer service
five stars and then some!!
the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful
i was visiting vegas and looked up boulder boats
she was very knowledgeable and willing to help
boulder boats is the greatest place to buy a boat
their customer service and satisfaction is elite
shout out to david h
for finding us our perfect boat
while it  pricey  that  a boat thing
gary is a pleasure to work with
left our boat her a while  he was super patient
purchased my boat on 5 or 15 or 15
my sales representative was john kozich
i never wanted a boat
until i did
the best answer is people
i love camping and i love being outdoors
my wife  not so much
so that  what i did
and i love them
it is never fun dealing with sales people
i am here to say he backed those words up
cool guy  and he really knows his stuff
incredible service? yep
that did not happen here
3 days later i owned the boat
simple as that
signing the paperwork took all of 10 minutes
no up-sells  no bs
just a simple and honest transaction
the way it should be
i should also mention they have a store
because of you all  i own a boat
my extended family keeps growing
now i wonder if they even changed the oil
first  the repair shop here is really  really busy
however  being busy is a consequence of location
busy is not an excuse for rudeness
that alone speaks volumes for customer care
buyer beware! andrea and brian carlin
stay away!
00 for a covered item
i said thanks and left
great service department
thanks for all the hard work and help
what a wonderful  wonderful place to be
oh well  maybe i will  jump in the lake
yes they do
i love hiker friendly locations
price was fair and i was happy to pay it
we stayed here for 3 weeks last winter
the family that runs this place is awesome
they are friendly and so helpful
they do their best to honor all requests
they take pride in their park and it shows
nice clean  wide spaces
easy access in and out
the rv parks in vegas are horrid
minutes from shopping in henderson
and it takes about 25 minutes to get to the strip
lots of them have pets as we do
quiet and very safe
the rv park is very reasonably priced
the hookups and sites are level and clean
thanks for a nice stay!
we enjoyed our stay at canyon trail
park was quiet with respectful neighbors
we felt safe while we stayed there
the grounds were well maintained
the staff were also very polite and helpful
highly recommend!
reasonable rates that include electric
no electric meters
close to vegas or lake mead or  hoover dam
boulder city is a nice quite city
basic cable
very pet friendly
owners are very good people
not  a whole lot of shade trees
no grassy area for dogs to run around
stephen arrived early and got to work
great job and customer service
these guys know what they are  doing
give em a try! you will  be glad ya did
hit n miss
asked the same when their employees arrived
i asked him to redo the trim
i called and expressed disappointment
i was told they would  return in a day or so
it  been a week
the price is very affordable
just had our 5th wheel and truck washed and waxed
today it was steven who came to do the job
he worked hard and did a did an excellent job
we had them wash & wax our vehicle
also  cleaned the windows
yes  that  highway robbery!!!
i would definitely recommend using their service
we had them wash & wax our vehicle
also  cleaned the windows
then  to find out by another employee
we were majorly over charged
that  just not satisfactory
thanks for caring enough to respond
totally recommend red rock
thanks brian and zack! our coach looks great!
absolutely the best rv wash i have  ever gotten
it looks almost like brand new!  thanks zach!
dirt  bugs  and whatever stuck all over
looks like new again! reasonable cost too
it was very convenient
the two guys were polite  thorough  and quick
they wax for $10 a foot if you need that service
they take personal interest in each job
they washed and hand waxed the entire coach
red rock rv wash is one you can trust
stephen did a fabulous job on our rv
nick did a terrific job
ask for nick!
i called and just wanted them to give her a wash
00 or  ft quoted  $190
oh     so thats ?why my rv looks so bad now
so my only other choice is to tell you folks
but it takes at least 2 guys to wax a rig nicely
i didnt get that
the company sent one
what a beautiful job he did
i am very particular about our coach
the job he did was outstanding
we had them wash & wax our vehicle
also  cleaned the windows
then  to find out by another employee
we were majorly over charged
that  just not satisfactory
thanks for caring enough to respond
he fit us into his busy schedule quickly
definitely recommend johns quality work!
i would  definitely recommend them!
he recommended red rock rv wash
one young man showed up
our trailer is 35' long
cost was $280
00 which based on the work was reasonable
best wash wax and detail i have had on my rv
very reasonable for the level of service
will use them anytime i am  in las vegas
i worked with three people  jason  scott  and mr
they work well as a team
thanks trevor
turned out to just be weeds in the water intake
my experience here has been amazing
rented twice from this location
had minor issues with the rv  but again  it  an rv
her name is debbie
she needs to be fired
an old unit
you will  get a great deal if you deal with wayne
you wo not  buy a better used rv anywhere else
i rented the 30 footer rv motor home
it was super quick
my family had an excellent 3-day weekend
i am  not impressed with this company
simply cancelled and that was that
the family trip is ruined
thank you cruise america!!!
highly recommend--fun  clean and affordable!!
easy to rent online and all the fees are shown
i would do it again
but not until almost 2 months later
do not  expect future business from me
an absolute waste of time
avoid these clowns at all costs
we would definitely rent from this company again!
the rv we rented was not properly maintained
we were fortunate not be involved in an accident
it was seamless and easy
thank you so much
i will  rent from them again !!!
this is our third rental from cruise america
the detail dept needs to do away with these
i am an easy customer to please
cruise america gave me a 30ft death trap
truly exceptional
worst company ever  run very fast away
00 deposit back
i am in shock that they treat customers this way
be sure to clean the unit upon return!
i like the experience of taking my home with me
ours was a 25' unit and it was older
not a big deal but an inconvenience
these units get hammered
we will return to cruise america
we have  rented from cruise america 3 times
once the rental was fixed  we returned back home
so that was nice of them
the heater was still not working
i basically paid $500 for a glorified tent
i also contacted the state attorney general
changes are subject to current availability
that is customer service
i managed supermarkets in nyc from 1973-2000
i am  a pro when it comes to customer service
the 1 800 number is the worst customer service
please rent from anyone else
these people are rude and non-customer oriented
on and on and on
a or c barely worked  heater did not  work at all
we were told to go buy a small space heater
crappy service gets crappy ratings
kids  9 and 11  loved it
no fees  you have enough on your mind already
this place has got it
needless to say not only did it cost us $2500
00 to rent but they kept our 500
it was easy to use for first timers
the service was friendly  charming and casual
thanks john and jackie
see you soon
ok  this was my 1st rv experience in 20 years
we had alot of fun and it was easy to do
things to buy and bring
sure enough  it was pretty much what we wanted
"on the lot  rod and ""captain g"" were incredible"
00 a month to the cost  you will  be glad for it
i asked him to break it down
suddenly  $30
00 a month became 42
00 a month
00 a month over the term
"he shrugged at says  ""whatever  bro"
""" sleazebag to the end"
once over email  once over phone
findlay clearly has winners and whiners
both great people
horrible experience here
very dishonest in my opinion
stay away from this place
got me in with very little lead time
good folks will be back
findlay the only one to call me back in a day
kevin chalker helped us so much
first time buying
which i plan to
staff is friendly
that being said thank god its under warranty
so advice for someone who has never bought new
the gentleman in the parts dept
mike in the service dept
was very professional and great to work with
i will never go back to camping world again
this time we feel we were taken advantage of
we got better odds at the gambling table!
service dept
is rude and very unhelpful
they offer you no information on your questions
go somewhere else to get parts and service
my experience with sales was fantastic
we took like 6 months before we made a decision
the customer service rep
i have purchased two trailers from van  rv
honest  friendly and very competitive
thanks guys!!!!ken wong
back at vans for an upgrade
love this place
anyone looking for a trailer  give them a look
will make you feel like family
great product and prices
exceptional service
there service dept is top notch
wont try to upsell you crap you dont need
thank you for making your customers feel valued!
first i was told my oil pan gasket was leaking
how much?? $300 or there about
again whoa! your radiator is dry
ca not  hold fluid
so we recommend forget the oil pan
but get a new radiator
$700+ picking up my  would efective radiator'
always ask for replaced parts
no one ever called
i am  a pretty patient person  and easy going
i am  going to be forced to use a chain place now
i highly recommend valley automotive
valley automotive will treat you fairly
valley automotive wo not  rip you off
they quote you fair prices
owner is a gentleman called kc
the managers name is mike
mike provides amazing customer service
he cares and will give you the best deal possible
i was floored
valley automotive saved me $900
they told me the truth
unlike that shop named p who tried to rob us
i have never felt so comfortable
i was very happy with their service
thanks again
5 minutes
and a bit physics application
thank you!!
honest  trustworthy auto repair
kc will not steer you wrong
oh my gosh what a horrific experience
well i did not  make it down there till 3 o'clock
there a transmission fluid all over the floor
but it sounded horrible coming home
no one knew what they were doing
honest and reliable it seems
the online service i received was great
i go here for parts for my rv
friendly  knowledgeable service
i would pass on this place
sales staff is much to be desired
call us  you will not be sorry
work is always guaranteed!
i would recommend it
clean and fair size sites
i recently rented an rv from going places rv
i will be returning to them for future rentals
we rented a toy hauler from these guys a month ago
turns out an axle on the toy hauler had broken
trailer was turned in  nothing was missing
these guys were amazing
the rig did great
do not waste your time here
move on to another agency
https: or  or drive
it was horribly misrepresented
if i could give this company 0 stars i would
stay away from this place
spend your money elsewhere
response within 10 minutes
absolutely outstanding! highly recommend
not sure how these guys stay in business
out-of-state buyers beware
sales tax can
during the first test drive
happy shopping
i would stay away from this place
this is not how you treat customers
gold star!  i was truly grateful
probably not the best idea i have  ever had
i do not  blame them
thank you!
they do not  miss a thing
my go to for all things rv
4 weeks later  no quote after multiple follow ups
do not  waste your time
ma  cave creek
run from these guys as fast and far as possible
these guys were great
staff were very helpful here at van city rv
so much for the two year warranty
music still gets played loud
find somewhere else to live people!!
this place actually deserves no stars
it  not even in a great neighborhood
the rent is waay too much for a little trailer
new manager you never see him
poor management
this is a great military only rv park
this was our first stay at an rv park
the staff were incredibly nice
the park is very quiet
the staff were aware
the park offers full and partial hookups
the park is clean and well maintained
lots of washer or dryers
clean shower facilities
the park is clean and well maintained
lots of washer or dryers
clean shower facilities
was greeted by friendly staff
the showers had good pressure and hot water
great place over all
highly recommend
arrived on time and they got to work right away
professional  courteous and efficient
highly recommend!
boat  or  trailer had to be flat bedded to house
i thank you richard!!!  christine
these guys are the best
very pleased with service and quality of work
thank you for providing excellent service
came in for a small weld job on my travel trailer
welds were perfect
good outfit that i highly recommended
it came out great and for a great price
eric is very courteous and professional
highly recommend!
best service  install  and follow up instructions
quick turn around time
i will definitely use this service again
he is professional and thorough
i know just enough to identify the fraud
he then did the routine maintenance
my older generator never ran better
i highly recommend juan and 4 points rv service
well  he showed up a couple of days later
on a sunday
in church attire
with his family
to measure
he did not  have to do that but he did
after he already worked 10 hrs
in the dark
i was impressed
really impressed
absolutely recommend
thank you juan
this elks has it all
we have  not heard one bad comment
prices are very  very low and servers excellent
other than that -- great park
one other thing that would be nice is good wi-fi
however  there is never any bandwidth
for us  it is like a home away from home
what else can i say
it really is as good as it gets for an elk lodge!
great people  and well run bar
check out the  alsa  big band and karoke nights
' great fun !
not very happy with the tempe rv park
merry christmas
i wish that rule was enforced a little more
i mean all over her face
i said something about it but it did not  change
the last thing is that they said she was biting
no biting
she sleeps and she eats
just wanted to update on children  safari
i thought it was going to be great
please try this daycare out
you wo not  regret it
this place was horrible
will never stay here again
stay away !!
i stayed at koa - charlotte or ft
the staff was friendly and helpful
we are  planning to go back next week
thanks for making my stay awesome
pros- convenient location
- cabins are clean and up to date
- lots are level for the most part
- surprisingly quiet given location
- pool  putt putt golf  and small playground
- pet friendly with a pet area
- staff is very friendly and professional
- carowinds 10 minutes away
- canaan zipline tours 20 minutes away
i kind of see that as a potential safety concern
- lots are small compared to other camp grounds
we counted only 14 chairs
it  not a propane grill
this park is subpar
first the good: convenient to everything
there is a publix supermarket right next door
most of the sites are not level
our power went out several times during our stay
not at all impressed
no security whatsoever!  no gates
we are here now - week of the fourth of july
yes bar - no one under 21 allowed
the other end of gas station is a liquor store
really only space for our 5th wheel
so we asked to move to a different site
one behind where we were
we needed to make sure the site was available
pool was nice and large
so- we are campers
"some would call it ""glamping"" but whatever"
the campground itself was a little odd
looking for some rollercoasters
great location and our 3 dogs loved it
very friendly and safe area
the covered wagon looks better than it ever has
it is retro
it is small
it is what we like
there are several long term occupants
be street  wise
carry a large dog on the end of a leash
she does a  great job on keeping the place clean
this could also act as a managers home or office
put a wall up on the north end
i would pay $10
replace with stamped concrete and astro- turf
we will come back
we came to phoenix for a short visit with family
each site has a cement pad as well as some grass
the grass in the park was well maintained also
there are lots of trees and lawn
we drove all the from puyallup wa to phoenix
we were ok with that
we just needed somewhere to park our rv
they have shuttle service 24hrs for you
my son  bike was stolen right next to our trailer
key for vandalism
the man next to our spot was racist and mean
nice rv park
lots of trees
most spaces are shaded
good size spaces
park was well kept
clean restrooms and pool
fair rates
we were only there for a few days for work
would return for sure
your contentious response supports all my claims;1
in the front office  to the manager ryan s
on up to the owner himself dan d
"all pro is simply that ""all professional"""
7  my ice chest is missing
loving the lake
good life is a great park with a lot of ammenities
it  kept up nice and always fun things going on
park managers are great and so is all the staff
i did one winter and loved it
i was not  too happy about that
i do not  like putting holes in my clothes
we called the office
two days later  the electricity went out again
this time my husband could not  get it working
a couple of days later  we had no water
he had no tools
the next day they got our water going
the office closes at 4 pm
needless to say  we will not return to this park
oops i am  not that old
i felt fortunate to be allowed to stay there
even for the one night
is this the taj mahal of rv parks? not at all
we have never had any issues
get over it
bottom line
we saw no sketchy behavior inside the park
we saw security patrolling every night
full hook ups @ $16
00 or night for first 2  then $20
00 or night is the special right now
that  what dry camping is for
anyways  we got an upfront spot facing boulder
usual noises  cars  trucks  sirens  helicopters
gal at front desk very accommodating  laundry $1
00 wash  $1
00 for 55 min
dryer time
skipping the showers  bathrooms and pool
of the few people we came across  friendly
mostly full-timers here
park seems well kept  but no security
would come here again next year
nice exploring this side of vegas
its pretty affordable place
you stay for under $400 a month + electricity
i stayed here with my travel trailer for 2 weeks
they have ok management
they only take cash!  the pool is ok
have laundry
a lot of full timers here
all in all
if you looking for cheap stay
i think this is the way to go
if you want more luxurious stay at the oasis
this place is not bad for the money
i am  also surprised by the negative reviews
they do have weekly and monthly rates
cash only
no credit cards
park felt safe and secure
no seedy characters
nice laundry room and showers
pet friendly at no extra charge
would have given them 5 stars but no wifi
manager was a lot nicer
made a reservation last night
they asked how much my dogs weighed
i was honest
all of them weigh less than 30 pounds
collectively they weigh 33 pounds
my very first time renting an rv
i was very nervous  but it was a great experience
some great things about this place: 1
the do not  nickel and dime you  3
full story below
first i will  address the product
as we exited i-10 the rv completely died
in the morning  there was no call
stay away!!!! do not rent from ca!!!
if i could give them zero stars i would
terrible customer service
i am so disgusted with this company
they are in for a fight because i want a refund
the problem was intermittent
smalley  the ceo of cruise america
rented an rv for a week to grand canyon and sedona
granted it took about 30 min to get our unit
would highly recommend renting from them
i am out $258
had an appointment to pick up rv at 1 pm
they did not  have our size cleaned yet
we waited 1 hour & 45 minutes
i am renting from cruise america and paying them
the customer should be the priority
i can warmly reccomend it
we had a terrible time with the coach we rented
thank you for your customer service
you do not see this alot these days
please send me details!!!
upon my arrive i sat down and waited
this company does not  keep its word
i called her this morning  credit card in hand
sorry  the deal is no longer available
you did not  pay  so no rv for you
i asked to speak to her boss
good luck if you rent from this company
was my first time renting or driving an rv
our vehicle was clean and comfortable
everything worked as advertised
pick up and drop off were a breeze
tina and karen were absolutely awesome
5 stars
beware!  be really careful using cruise america
basically i advise you stay away
we just got back from our first rv trip
the unit was clean and ready to go when promised
we will return to cruise america
this is the corporate office
last year my mom became sick and was hospitalized
they did some tests and found cancer
stage four  untreatable
we turned on the fridge
not working  but we could smell the propane
so we are finally here!! at our destination
we had to scoop it out with a bucket
terrible service
this could have been so much simpler
cruise america
where to even begin
that was over a month ago
we will never rent from cruise america again
each time we rented the 30' camper
the first experience was great
the second was not in the best of condition
now to the real problem
49 cents to mail me the notice
i paid $1 862
92 for six nights and he  worried about
49 cents in postage for a return customer
we had a great time in a compact 19--footer
for 2 people and 2 dogs it worked out perfect
would do again
poor poor service and attitude
money driven at any expense
since then  it has been flawless and a pure joy
i live it it full time
it is the care free lifestyle i had imagined
i would not rent from them if i was you
will never buy anything from findley ever again
so findley does not  report the claims
possibly contacting an attorney at this point
we have had our camper for 11 months
it  gone from bad to worse
never buy from these people
they really are the best
happy trails!
love our used trailer
3 out of 4 lost their tread first long trip
8 years old
looked good but were not
so we installed it our self
it  112 degrees out and we r living in the rv
so i call dometic they say that not true
they are very nice people and did a great job
as for findlay they suck
kathy was confident it would sell
we have a new friend
we live and travel the u
in our travel trailer
the only place with any availability stay away!
keep up the great work
the sales staff is a joke
they are lazy  unprofessional  smokers and drunks
they think they are too good
the service department is just as bad
trust me  they rig everything
do not buy from this dealership
findlay was able to help us much faster
everyone we dealt with was friendly  and helpful
we got a great price on exactly what we wanted
highly recommend!
unless you are ready to buy right then and there
if you are looking  stop by and ask for kevin
a few of the issues were quite vexing
i am  a 'fix it right the first time' woman
what brent had fixed had no impact on the problem
we bought our travel trailer from vans
they are a wonderful christian family
they all work there dad mom sons wife it  great
vans not only answered all our questions
price was perfect
anyways  onto my review
"this is now my ""go to"" place"
very honest and reliable
and my air conditioning works great!!!
casey and mike will treat you right
kc  steve  and sam
great mechanic
cane through with some brake issues on the road
this review is a long time coming
remember  you get what you pay for
this shop is top notch
mike was very friendly
they got the car right in with no appointment
that  hard to find these days
valley automotive has a customer for life
thank you for the pleasant experience
went in for it a routine oil change
i know because i have  been to a few in my day
highly recommended!
found valley automotive by looking up reviews
i could not  of asked for a better experience
such an honest group of guys
i wish i could give you 6 stars!
i highly recommend valley automotive
they are honest  efficient and courteous
kc and his team are awesome
i ca not  recommend this auto shop more
charged us to repair the engine
guaranteed their parts and labor for 12 months
the issue never came to resolution
you have  been made aware!
oh my gosh what a horrific experience
well i did not  make it down there till 3 o'clock
there a transmission fluid all over the floor
but it sounded horrible coming home
no one knew what they were doing
i would not  give it one star but i had no choice
00 off lol what a joke
upon my arrival my check engine light came on
so i knew i was in for a long few days
everyone is always looking for an honest mechanic
i found this mechanic in casey and his team
i felt prepared
you have my referral for life!
mike was amazing
mike was thorough and checked ever little thing
when i got my car back it ran like i just got it
they are super nice there
thank you to kc and mike for being super amazing
best customer service i have  seen in an auto shop
this place is fantastic
but i deafly will come back no complaints here
i am a local person from northeast ohio
i need some warranty work done
i am  definitely going to sue this outfit
buyer beware!!
"""  however  i do not  believe this is true"
i began making calls and stumbled upon les
a gem of a find and a good guy!
cannot recommend bumper masters enough!!!
my car looks as good as new
so i called and spoke with les
brought the car to him on late friday afternoon
i picked up the car on sunday afternoon
it looked brand new
les was more than accommodating to my schedule
les was really great to work with
the final result was outstanding
could not tell that any work had been done
highest recommendation
looks brand new
also very reasonably priced and quick turnaround
very happy with the service we received
thanks for the great work
the campground is not large
i think there are fewer than 40 sites
all of them are suitable for rv and trailer
the ground is grass covered
some sites have fire pits  some do not
this is a top notch organization
staff was top notch
both friendly and professional
top class organization and location
highly recommend this location in avondale
all in all we thoroughly recommend
thanks again and keep up the good work
my first experience with going places rv was great
shame on you and it  time to boycott
do yourself a favor
save your money find another company
especially for what they charge
please beware of this place
and the establishment itself
those people are morons
that is the hallmark of a good company
4 or 5 stars
it had lots of cosmetic damage
she told me she is charging me anyway
they said they would inspect it and call us
they never did
when i spoke to her about it she was very rude
"she told me ""i hope you do!"""
lesson learned
we will never rent there again
i took pictures of the trailer before and after
he took his employees word and dismissed mine
i did not deny them entry
when they came again we were not there
things like that happen sometimes
i was offered a $50
00 discount that  all
"our biggest problem was the ""fresh "" water"
it was not fresh or clean
it smelled horribly like sewer
they do not put clean water in the units
we had never driven an rv before
her staff was equally accommodating & friendly
all looked good
and boom! it did not work
we were shocked
we asked how long would that take? he said
about an hour? we said
that  really going to put us behind on our trip
we felt bad
and we rented from an individual
i am  not sure why you are contacting me now
you were down right rude and unprofessional
there are no deals to work out
you already ripped off my credit card
we wo not  make that mistake again
this place did not  even pro rate the daily fee
the rig we bought was exactly as advertised
well worth the drive
two thumbs up !
up-date from my previous entry on 6 or 24 or 2015
it was very well received at our end
the owner did not  give two bits
the thief knows what he did and karma is a b!t€h
great service!
would give this place -1 star if i could
never ever set foot in this place
getting it back was a problem
add another $250 to the bill for new batteries
in fact  the opposite
pricing was more than fair and direct
there were no add on charges or surprises
"the ""right stuff""!"
we are on number 3 in 13 months from wagon trail
they are the best of the best
that is why we keep returning
the team they have put together there is awesome
john  rusty and everyone else
they just keep getting better
we highly recommend a stop there and a long look
i wish to commend jennifer and ben
i was referred to wagon trail by camper world
this company sells quality vehicles
i dropped in on friday  unexpected
no pressure  and what a great salesagent
i am  a retired journalist  my wife is a homemaker
we are normal people
simple as that
do not  even try opening facebook it never works
the laundry facility is awkward and small
really makes it awkward
it  so weird
lastly  the playground lord oh lord
it is old outdated and falling apart
i have no comparison since this is my 1st rv park
the rv park personnel seem very nice and helpful
i am told that the amenities are standard
it  hard to beat a rate of $22 per day
also  the washer and dryer loads are only $
75 per load
the gas station is less than a mile away
if they had  i deserved it
my mobile phone lte is much faster
the wifi is horrible
at least they tell you that at check-in
they are everywhere
"some are no longer ""happy campers"""
monthly discounts would be awesome
but not available here
trees need trimmed back from camper areas
non stop pigeons not charming making their mess
no wifi unless you go to the office
good service
hitch has been working great
i would  use them again
richard was great to deal with
he gave me a quote over the phone and appointment
so grateful i found this place
great experience
i dropped it off at noon
price was more than right  less than he quoted me
i highly recommend them
shannonirondrive coatings
this is an old fashioned customer service place
i second all the good things said here
could not  be more pleased
pretty much calling me a liar
they did a nice job on the hitch install
juan was very knowledgeable  friendly and helpful
he went out of his way to help me over the phone
a very ethical and professional service
they do excellent work
i will use them again
but he never showed up or called
still have not  heard from him!
i wont trust anybody else to work on mine
they did an outstanding job
i would not hesitate using then again
they were very through and honest
highly recommend them for any rv repairs
that  right  folks
update to follow
great lodge in the best traditions of the order
and the weather is phenomenal!
amazing  friendly & safe
way to go tempe elks
we will have to say that ms
pam is by far our favorite
i am so happy i chose children  safari
thank you kathy and children  safari!!!!!
children  safari is top notch
the facility is new and impeccably clean
everything is spot on
i just ca not  say enough good things about them
we love children  safari
they are patient
highly recommend to anyone looking for childcare
we love sharing these with grandparents
this review is long overdue
we never had a problem there
very informative about the activities of the day
always welcoming and polite and professional
thank you!! we love you children  safari!
artwork was never sent home
also weird
only playing
while teachers just sat around watching
everything there was just drab
kind of ironic
just makes me wonder what was going on
he started when he was 6 weeks old
he absolutely loves them
i would not  recommend working here
no colors  no light
very scary to a child
the smell of dirty diapers was over whelming
it was dirty  smelly and depressing
clean  safe environment
i have a large class a with tow vehicle
no picnic table at any of the sites
these people are ridiculous! never again !
really lousy thing to do to people!
stayed here for 8 nights
this is what we experienced
pros:* huge spaces
that should have been a sign to us right there
on the bed  there are a couple of dead roaches
however  the doors are closed and locked shut
we should have left and found a hotel
46 at most places  but almost $5 a gallon here
"""been that way for ten years"""
i have to agree with glen r
no frills  but not expensive either
the camp store is not  a camp store
in the grass!  here  the worst part
no doubt from the drunks leaving the bar
this was a first for me
never again!
it was perfect for what we needed
very clean and the quiet
its offseason so the place was relatively empty
kids took advantage of playground and mini golf
will use this place again in the future
this was the most odd koa we have stayed at
other reviewers comments are accurate
no onsite personnel
unloved  uncared for  and just plain sad
just a little weird
the pool is blue and the water clean and inviting
cozy little rv park
i would come here again
the good news is lots of grass
above and beyond
easy access to highways and shopping
do not  miss this spot
the neighborhood is dicey at best
not a place for an evening stroll
we had 7 people and a gagle of dogs
the people in the park were very friendly
it was close to shopping and the university
thank you  angie!
we would give lower rating but ca not
first the park is in a risky neighborhood
it was another campers pet
he went after it
she proceeded to yell at me about my dogs
you do not  have to here
they are great!
no  it  not a pool
no  it  not a hipster place
and that  not a bad thing
brought the kids here for a day as a guest
i understand all the previous reviews
however  change does not  happen overnight
the new owner has come in with rules
these are being done
as the campground was in past years
we would have never  ever camped there
we took a chance and got a site this year
every week it improves
we will be return campers
we stayed at this park for 3+ months this winter
the other spaces are used for the rvs
the spots are on the small side
our 43' rv barely fits
the amenities of the park are the selling point
if you are bored at this park  you did not  try
see our full review at www
thegilliamsisland
no traffic noises where i am at!
looks nice but looks can be deceiving
had my wallet stolen
had my wife and children threatened
well  enjoy because this is the park for you
please stay here carefully
for sightseeing tours headed north
use caution when renting from this company!
this was our first time renting an rv
we were very happy with phoenix motorhomes
return was quick and easy
we did not  experience that at all
thank you all so very much
i cannot wait to go camping!!
largest inventory of airstreams in the area
we liked that
the finance people   without a question
thank you everyone
truly amazing trailers
i will be buying one in the near future
best of luck to them in every way
really great people  experience and all
out trip is ruined
cant find a trailer now
jared was great to deal with from the start
he had great communication
the trailer was clean and in very good shape
the marina is cool  but very pricey
website does not tell the truth
do not  stay here trust me on this one
eagle view rv resort
this place is awful
it  rv hell
it  not great for tent camping
it was pretty creepy and bordered on harassment
you will probably not fit in
you are not allowed to use the grass
it  a rule
the electricity does not work very well  either
ca not  wait to come back!!!!
on march 11th 2016 my family
ultimately  my wife simply took what mrs
we store our coach here as well
the set up on passes is inconvenient and a hassle
they have mobile propane though!
we wish we had more time  we will be back
this is a must stay if you have not  stayed yet
we wish we had more time  we will be back
this is a must stay if you have not  stayed yet
very affordable  informative and thorough
we enjoyed the sand sport toy hauler
we will  definitely be back again!
they showed me everything i needed to know
i definitely recommend boulder city rv
they will definitely be my go to!!!
i bring all my vehicles big boy toys
highly recommend
you will  get your money  worth and more
they really care
and he charged way too much
not to mention his drug use
do yourself a favor and stay away from this prick
alfredo is a straight up honest guy
i will be taking my classic car to him
i will never go to another bodyshop
i highly recommend alfredo at big boys toys
they did a great job in a timely manner
super easy to work with
we are going back for a new awning
highly recommend
these guys treat me like family!  i store my 32 ft
i am grateful to have them!
well  for starters
horribly managed
what more could one ask for these days
0 unit within that time frame
thanks james!
what a horrible holiday weekend
people were rude and swore like sailors
music in our area was blaring until nearly 3 am
not a warm fuzzing feeling at all
what an absolute shame
sounds great  right? wrong
everything looked worn and old
"all they said was  ""sorry"
our family had a good time at crystal lake
we rented a cabin for $85 or night for all of us
- everyone was friendly and helpful
-the swimming pool is huge and well maintained
they even have a lifeguard on duty
- you can rent a pontoon boat and or or golf cart
- our cabin
we just camped here the weekend of 7 or 16 or 16
we had a great time
the staff was very friendly and attentive
by 12:10 the noise was pretty much gone
great people camp there
i do not recommend this campground
been going here for years
i will definitely be coming back this year
very nice  well maintained  and secure facility
i would not recommend this storage at all
it is poorly maintained and not customer friendly
obviously it was a problem and i paid it
very unhappy
nasty is the perfect word
we are in or out through the gate and pay online!
wow! talk about rude
life is too short to deal with nasty people
warning  this may be lengthy - it  just how i roll
i scoured travel trailer forums  reviews  etc
5 hour drive
they opted to put in a different hitch
this was something that was not expected
thanks  brad & sharon johnson
the salesman was rude
we were in mesa shopping for a gently used rv
we pulled into their lot and parked
nothing else - just walked away
our goal
we had not  heard of a thor before
howard was great
he absolutely deserves your business
great company good experience
treated well by salesman  service manager and corp
got a great deal on a used travel trailer here
all worked
stopped into rv traders
no hard sell here
very good experience
he absolutely deserves your business
honest people  great prices
a business run the right way
jack was the best
no high pressure
we would shop here again
daily and weekly  no check necessary
they were not even apologetic
the manager glared as i complained
thanks for my service!
the office was closed at this point
several cats were roaming about
a couple dogs were barking non stop behind us
just do not
there were be available hotels  so here we are
the bathrooms are clean  so i gave another star
what a load of crap
tip to the owner
worst experience ever
i would leave negative stars if i could
just atrocious and completely unprofessional
**update** if the owner
obviously nothing has changed here
worst rv dealer in the valley
thanks guys you are the best
it  absolutely beautiful and quiet here
you could not  beat the price either
we will definitely be back!
great park
very quiet
clean restrooms and showers
lots of golf close by
campsites are spacious with full hook-ups
to my surprise a man answers
incredibly clean  immaculate bathrooms and shower
owner is very very friendly
park is beautiful and quite
bathrooms do need a upgrade other wise great park
host were very helpful and polite
just purchased a camper and traveling home
very friendly  beautiful setting
do not  let the proximity to highway concern you
very nice campground with very friendly owners
very pleasant surroundings
i would  definitely give this a 4 plus
by all means  give it a try!!!
the owner was most helpful and pleasant
i slept great the three days we were there
our space was unpaved  but level
the hookups were convenient
the nightly rate was inexpensive
would i recommend this park? yes
would we come back? yes
informational: we travel in a 36' class a rv
we stopped her on our way back to chicago
we arrived
definitely recommend this place
awesome experience with this company
great rv rental experience
high quality equipment and service
will definitely come back to rent again!
for the most part our experience was ok
we rented the rv for a week in january
we rented the chevy gulfstream
the rv itself was in decent condition
it was very clean
however  we came to regret it
this is why i gave them only 2 stars
prompt response to calls
not their fault  and they handled it well
they were so easy to work with
everyone i worked with were great
very helpful and flexible
we had to wait to the last minute to book our rv
he was very accommodating
great location near the airport
we had the rv for a week  no problems at all
we had a great trip and it was the best price
will only be renting from them in the future!!
fair rates and great customer service
would not  hesitate to rent from again
i have to say that this company is awesome
pretty rare these days but very nice to see
try them- you will not be disappointed!!!!!az101
thanks again to scott & todd at cactus rv center
could not  have done it without you
i will highly recommend you to family and friends
very easy to coordinate until i signed the papers
i was wrong
being new to the rv world  this company rocked it
"thank you guys for taking good care of the""beast"""
sorry we left out rv there
another person came as well and same thing
office locked
you will  be sorry if you store anything there
love the family that manages this place
always happy  helpful and friendly
prices are the best in town too!!
the room temperature was totally uneven
we found the room exactly how we left it
rooms need additional updating
pull out couch would be nice
so my room was hot
tub needed to be repaired
carpet dirty
but unhappy with their lucky slot players
just saying
but then again  it is vegas
well rooms umm the suite had 2 beds ava
"if you like ""locals casinos""  ac  is fairly decent"
the dealers are fun and friendly
my room was very tidy & clean
this place is a dump
it  even worse than the other one on decatur
note: this review is strictly for the rv park
called this afternoon to seek some information
a little training goes a long way
returned over the holidays and was very pleased
buffett was good  virtually no lines
you can hear noise from nearby rooms
i would still return
it was clean and quiet place to stay there
clean room clean towel heater on
everything was perfect
recommend the wings
ca not  really comment on anything else though
horrific hotel! hair on bedding
non-smoking rooms smell of smoke
sink did not  drain
to look away
know and see what she could do for us
we never heard from her  no apologies or anything
i play and eat there
always great service
workers there even know my name
i love their comp system there
better than i have  seen at other casinos
this is for the cheesesteak grill
and now they have a few new offerings
un-sauced wings?  i wo not  eat them
this hotel is the worse place to come to
they charge tou $11
99 a day for internet use
when other hotel has the internet for free
plus i have a two children that drinks milk
never got the refrigerator but got charged
and our room keycard for our room did not work
never came back
to everyone who is driving or visiting vegas
pleas please
this review is for the casino only
blunt  to put it mildly
the pads are concrete which is nice
level which helps level the unit
that is the second plus
the dog run was ok but small
staying at the rv park
it  not just this visit the wifi is bad
it  every visit
also no can or bottle or plastic recycling
they could donate the cans
do not  like to bitch but feel like i have too
what internet they said
the wifi sucks more and more everyday
once we leave here we will never come back
this is a simple  with basic frills
the room we stayed in had two basic rooms
the price is cheap and so is the food
however  it was worse than i expected it to be
the steak had a sour taste so i could not eat it
i told the waiter but he did nothing
not one redeeming quality
absolutely a shithole
buffet is barffet
rude cocktail waitresses that never come around
ive waited up to 2 hours for a drink
rest of the line was ok
food was cold
good way to produce bacteria and food poisoning
would not recommend
stayed here for edc friday night to monday night
the bed took up most of the room
they would order two plates per person
we are  not complaining for the price
the employees are friendly though
seriously  we were greeted by them
the room we had was nice and clean
i ca not  deal with ho  and crackheads!
worst stay ever!checked in friday march 23
if i could give zero stars rooms were mediocre
but that  not even the issue
i was followed by head of security robert  klaus
like i was a criminal
which i did
never go to this racist hotel!!
horrible hotel
can hear every noise from adjacent rooms
no free wi-fi
not worth your time or safety to stay here
i was not expecting to win any money here
really good stay and i stayed for a few nights
no hot water  soap that does not  lather
you get what you pay for
the room was about 30x50sq
"easily the worst room i ever ""stayed"" in"
got there the night after christmas with family
had booked a king deluxe room through expedia
contacted me
the catering manager to make sure all was good
our hotel room was simple and clean
sheets were clean  no bed bugs
bathroom or bathtub all clean  no mold or cracks
basic wifi is free for up to 3 devices
service was fine
everyone we encountered was friendly
you almost feel like you are  in the ghetto
the room was well just barely okay
the internet is 12 bucks per day per device
not good for my taste
there  an acute lack of plugs for anything
off to find another hotel for the next night
another adventure in hotels  i will not repeat
this is my first time here
from los angeles and was here for christmas
the receptionist  was super nice
i got  2 nights for $100 which was great!
"those reviews were ""spot on"
gets to pay the shortage out if his own pocket
we had a great time here
do not  miss out on eating here  you will love it
this place is ghetto and old
the establishment has not  made upgrades in years
i did not  even feel safe in the hotel
i had the supposedly sweet
there was nothing sweet about this room
the furniture looked like it was from the 80
it was so bad   i called hotels
this place is low priced
there was no resort fee  so the price on orbitz
com for my two night stay came out to $53
00 and change with tax
really like most of the bartenders here
not like some casinos
was last here in 2006 and was better then
hotel rooms need a major renovation
what a nasty place
reminded me of an old run down retirement home
it would be the last
truly  just a nasty place
being enclosed
southwestern  as the decatur location is
the bathroom was a bit small  but no complaints
the sourdough cafe was teriffic
however  i ca not  fault the hotel for this
give it a try!
my room was not  clean well
disgusting and full of smokes! rude waitresses
i will never come here again
good price  moderate accommodations
weird people walking around  but not crowded
the casino was typical  i guess
i do not  know if they have table games
it smelled like smoke when you walk in
it  ok i guess
you get used to it
the restaurants are ok
the fries were very standard and typical too
they needed some salt
the service was friendly
went to monster cup supercross at sam boyd stadium
perfect for the event about a 6 minute drive
hotel was clean my room was very nice
prices were very reasonable
i gave 3 stars only because no food room service
it was more like a apt
she was extremely rude
i stayed nice and calm
overall  according to my dad  the hotel was nice
we will  spend a little extra next time
i wish i could give this hotel a zero star rating
arizona charlies is dirty and disgusting
the place is filthy and smells
rv park  has a separate entrance
pets cannot be over 35 lbs
not for us
$32 or  night
$180 or  week pull thru
cost is up to $650 a month  including utilities
add 12% tax
this place was pretty good
motel 6 would be better than here forsure!
old tv sets  poor cable channel selection
seedy neighborhood
casino smells of cigarette smoke
dirty bar or lounge
rude front desk staff
homeless man took a bath in the hot tub one night
please save your time and money
very seedy and lots of scary people
in the dark
so yeah  if you are  thinking about staying here
it smells better
disgusting
our couch had a huge stain on it
the carpet was beyond filthy
frankly i was horrified
never again
but i can vouch for our room which was clean
as soon as i entered the room  i was appalled
99 per day
the casino and restaurants were lovely though
worst experience ever
my kids were afraid to sleep alone
staff did not  seem to care to much
bugs!!!! yes bed bugs!!! i called the news station
after everything we had been thur
i was in a tight situation
my car had broken down
a family friend recommend the hotel
clean and great value
the next day one of us got bit on the arm
we did not  thing nothing of it at first
put to depoists hold on both cards
leaving me short about 100 dollars
we sleeped on one of the beds
and we call the front desk
almost instantly they upgraded us a suite
at this point we checked out right away
wait on a risk management to call back
i will never stay in any hotels in vegas
the tv remote was sticky and grimy
if you do not  have to  do not  stay here
it  partially my fault for selecting ac
for a saturday night  we ended up paying $71
its mostly older folks and families
the cheapest rooms are old
no exaggeration
$3 blackjack helps pass time as well
i probably would not  stay here again
i wouldnt even give this place one star
go to motel 6 or something like that
------------the 2 star review just became a 1 star
one final update
seems they just never show up
someone asked me what arizona charlie  was like
my king suite    but it is in the running
i have  stayed here many times
i rather like the east side of town
but a fat lot of good it does here
there was always a room available
not with a smile  not with the slightest apology
just a smirk and a like it or lump it attitude
it  such a stupid policy
but i will never stay here again in the summer
mikey c says: it  like camping  but indoors!
i would tell you to run the opposite way
wow ! what could i say about this place
we got the room and the carpets were filthy
that  crazy
the website pictures shows it
the customer service was terrible
the service this morning was excellent
i go here 3 to 4 times a month and will continue
the thanksgiving buffet was very nice
i asked for dark meat and got a whole turkey leg
it was delicious
the room was gross
customer service is definitely lacking
we will not be returning
we checked in
it was not a pleasant room
7 or 11 or 17
called my cc company to dispute
walked in at 3:45 with a big smile
best foot spa is right close to lee  liquor
by the time i got to arizona charlie  i was set
i was feelin' good
very good
check in was pleasant
i smoked and i smoked and i smoked
you smoke like that you gonna get hungry
and that  exactly what happened
and i had a really good smoke going on
that would buy me at least an hour or so
they are  not quick
turned out to be a good choice
the cheesesteak i had was pretty dang good
i am  good with that
mikey c says: where there  smoke
where to start with this place
if you are  looking for something dirt cheap
pretty much the deciding factor why we chose it
ugh  wtf? your site said animal friendly
the rooms are not what the site says
there are no kitchen areas  no fridges
do they even hire cleaning maids?4
the beds are god awful as far as comfort
to my disbelief  the ground smelled like feces
could this place get any worse? yes it can!5
i would give this place 0 stars if possible
they are  lucky to even get one
avoid at all costs
do not  even consider
me and my friend came into town and stayed here
the room was exceptional
had a couch and bed and tv in one room
then the other room had a bed and tv
the buffet isnt the biggest but the price is good
security roaming around kept things quiet
not far to the strip
a 7-11 is right around the corner
played in the bingo hall and had a blast
the pool was fun too
this place an absolute crap hole
it  kind of far from the strip also
proscheap price
conscheap feel
horrible lighting
would i come here again? no
unfortunately it was not  the experience i wanted
i have never heard of a hotel that charges $11
99 a day per device for wifi
are you serious
we got charged $11
00 to print and use the computer for 3 min
1st strike
when we got to the room  the card did not  work
went back to the front and got new ones
from that point only 1 worked
s before and had done the dirty
it was a bad smell
for the 1st 2 days we did not  have any hot water
i waited 20
wtf no one could not  tell us that
s to check out and than hung up on me
i was done
we packed up everything and went and checked out
i am officially done with coming here
never again
for obvious reasons
the hotel is not attached to the casino
it has a small pool  which i did not  use
the room i stayed in was actually pretty nice
it was a one bedroom suite and it was quiet
the only good item on the buffet was the salad bar
all in all an unappetizing buffet
the picture that i took was deceiving
i saw the steak and eggs special for $7
wo not  be going back!
that does not  flush
decent  basic  affordable
we needed a hotel room for edc weekend
there  no refrigerator  no safe  low lighting
saw a bug in the room
i would  come back
first time staying away from fremont or the strip
the rooms are very basic  but overall clean
casino was boring and i lost money
i know now
this is a disgusting hotel worst experience
not bad place at all
everything was clean
basically a motel 8
if you just need a place to sleep perfect
the casino is a decent size
stayed there looking for property this weekend
the suite area was very nice - lots of room
the cable once was great
we pay $$ to stay here & to use the amenities
the dumpster are not  in the enclosures
the rv park office people used to be very nice
the last year or so i am  not feeling very safe
not a bad hotel  i got what i paid for
reasonable priced placed around
its way too smoky to stay and play anyway
stayed here thursday 6 or 22 or 17
eww!got our rooms
we will definitely put this hotel last on our list
the buffet was horrible
the service was good and friendly
the beverage servers were non existent
the yukon grille is the best
do not  waste your money at ron  steak house
this is the far best than that restaurant
dollar wise you ca not  beat it
our server was annmarie  who is an asset
what a mistake
all you have to do is check the pay tables
lots of loser bums in this place
specifically
the front desk supervisor
worst experience ever
pros--only a few miles from sam boyd stadium
near some good fast food joints
too far off the strip and no real nightlife
they charge you $11
place is incredible!! clean and affordable
friendly staff
except for the meat cutters at the buffet
"""kids meal"""
review is for room only
its very rundown looking
restroom was very confined
my car trunk seemed bigger
not that i have used it as a restroom or so
aside from the room
everything else is just just average or below
valet dude was polite
insisted on tip even tho he never parked our car
front desk guy was cool
fail! 2 or 5 because i have had much better
esp in vegas!
also they have shitty customer service
the bad parts is its in a sketchy hood
it  an outside hotel
casino is seperate from the hotel
onto the room
the furniture was very outdated
"bes bugs!!! yes the ""hotel"" is cheap"
this place is deplorable
also  i was bitten while i stayed over night
it was horrible
absolutley expensive and horrible
the shower is an enigma to figure out  though
99 a night it  not really worth it anyway
do not  know how they keep the doors open
if i could give this place a zero i would
i had reservations thru vegas
com & apparently they over booked my room
i would never go here again
i am  a poker player always looking for an edge
i prefer budget accommodations
there is an outdoor pool on site but no gym
i dont see why all the one star reviews
its a cheaper option off the strip
we got a suite
the room was clean
i was happy
pool was nice daughter loved it
dinner buffet was good
no bed bugs
room 3302  the toilet is hella loose and crooked
minor complaints
charlies was cool
this is a nice place off the strip
the rooms were fine
this is the worst buffet in town
prime rib has no taste  shrimp was cold
very small selection
one poor guy waiting on the whole room
will never go back even for free
my opinion is go to sam  town firelight buffet
there is now a modest resort fee
so i do not  stay here anymore
it was fun while it lasted
and $1 bloody marys and mojitos is an added bonus
absolutely rediculas!!
2 rooms  with 2 beds! for the price
it  so worth it! 24 hr bingo is another bonus
the buckets of beer for $5
free parking and no resort fees
especially when i dont hang out on the strip much
i prefer the double-down saloon and the dive bar
im very thankful for that
update: they added resort fees
still super cheap though so i will just pay it
very poor customer service experience
park is stale
just a trailer trash type of rv park overall
i will never come back to this place
a great vegas rv park
the best and safest in the area
thank you duck creek!
did not  pay it and did not  use their pool
very reasonable price with passport america
stayed in a 30ft 5th wheel
very nice place
park is very clean= staff is nice
power is dependable and wifi is good
restrooms very clean
very quiet residents
not far to vegas attractions
have been here a week and a half so far
nice plantings and greenery around facilities
all started off well enough but turn bad
first off the park does not  feel like a rv park
makes for a very tight in and out
not much of anything else
only two picnic tables in the whole park
my friend said to check my vm
i really could not  believe it
waving her smoke in my face
she could not  find anything
we saw german shepard as well
i would not  recommend for families
from the strip
the people at the desk were really nice
the atmosphere pleasant all around
the sites were paved and level
this place seemed perfectly safe
i would stay here again for sure
look elsewhere for your stay
restrooms and laundry are clean and modern
staff is incredibly helpful
all sites are paved which is really nice
there are a few pull through sites
most sites are back in
costco is there
many of the streets have bike lanes
there is also a large park that is next door
the long term residents are really friendly
i did not  use the park wifi
i really like this place
more of a long term rv park
a reasonable $32 with good sam discount
restrooms  showers  pool and free wifi
i would steer clear from this place
it has a close proximity to the strip
would i recommend this park? absolutely
would we come back? absolutely
four stars
it  cheap  safe  and quite
duck creek rv park is a wonderful place to go
this is your guy for everything trailer
man is a boss
even ac units
called them twice for repair of my rv
i will be a repeat customer for sure
"when we got there we were told it was ""too risky"""
even had access to the canal trail and wifi
we will stay here again
this place is behind a motorcycle repair shop
they are incredibly nice and accommodating
we slept and took the rv to the stadium and back
it is quiet  clean  and reasonably priced
i would stay here again
quiet little park off main street
always kept clean and maintained
i really liked that they allow pets here
will be returning
we stayed 30 days and had a very enjoyable stay
the spaces are not all the same length
the park is very clean  and quiet
the motorcycle shop was not a problem
we would stay there again
we have two harley  and gravel is not a friend
the road thru the park is paved
this is a small  quiet well kept rv park
we recently stayed at twin palms for 2
5 months with our two dogs
they care about their customers
the best wifi anywhere
steve   also owns a cycle shop
one person only
it  quite small but laid out very well
the owner was very nice and accommodating
stayed here at steve  lot for 4 months
very accommodating
that is the reason for taking a star away
they do not provide dish soap
they have tvs which have netflix only
the little studio cabins all have small balconies
the rest of the cabins do not have balcony
words cannot describe how amazing this place is
my family came here for a mini retreat
we found out about this location from airbnb
there is also a marina on site that rents boats
the master room had a comfortable mattress
the bathroom linens were thick
the sheets were standard
the decor was super cute and comfortable
air conditioner worked perfectly
we were very comfortable
they will soon start renting 2br glampers
ca not  wait to stay here again!
25 min from my home
my son has fallen in love
we found our peace and happiness again here
thank you david  rebekah and matthew
thanks mark
these guys are amazing
also his mechanic knows his stuff inside and out
brought my rv in for some miner body work
marshall quoted a fair price
great job!
about a 45 minute drive
"""conservative"" state? ha! highly recommend!"
ummm no  how about a 1 star
make that 0 stars
this was not the case at all
so on and so on
we went and picked up our boat after three weeks
i would not recommend this shop
i know you say well have them fix it further
they did find me one in there shop to replace
where do i begin? wow
horrible financial customer service
do not  expect your deposit back anytime soon
they told me 5 business days
well tomorrow makes 10 business days
i have  left 3 messages and no return call
what a joke
so an update as of april 29th 2016
i repeated myself
which of course no one responds to
do not  go here  not worth your money
just using the dumping facilities which were $10
this guy was incredible
happy camping to all
henderson police are there on a daily basis
this place works
want loud  not too busy
they have a pool
our family was transitioning from hawaii
we forgi t about this one incident
moving again was a nightmare
thanks for nothing kings row
we moved to the desert sands rv resort
a match made in heaven
"""     desert sands rv resort is well maintained"
the rent is better too
the gate is secured at night
in fact  we have been invited back
we have  been going here for over 30 years
i feel their pricing is fair
i feel they try to do their best with each repair
they could not  have been nicer
the charge was very very reasonable
honestly ca not  recommend them enough
just parked our bus there
good storage rate and easy process
will post my experience here as well
told her thank you for checking
the proprietors are honest and friendly
steve made repairs to our motor home
will definitely be back for any future repairs
fast & reliable service at a reasonable price
i love this place
family run honest shop in glendale
probably the best rv place in arizona
good prices and honest people
you will  be glad you did
when in the southwest i will be a loyal customer
the staff is friendly
rv i will  be referring all of my friends
thank you for everything
i would recomend this business to everyone
great family company
we have stored our rv here for years
i would highly recommend them to everyone
we recommend them to all our rving friends
dave steep
buyer beware!!!!  do not  by from them
also  do not  buy starcraft
however  i was not  going to just say ok
disconnect the power and lp
my wife and i did that
easy job
took fifteen minutes
my wife helped me get it in place
we are  both retired
i wo not  go back there again
sales  finance  service and follow up
very poor communication even from the sales people
and we still have to steam the carpets
really wish i had taken pictures along the way
it was that bad
we could go on
will never deal with them again
if i could put a zero star i would
i had an apt with jason which he was late
i had specified exactly what i wanted
i saw it
and he said no i was wrong they do not
then he said i should hand crank it
he never gave it to me
the finishing touches were not very nice
it  everywhere
no worries we waited
he got his pamphlets out sat down
we were standing
by the way
we went to racetrack rv
they did have a pullout in the sport package
the sales people were professional
they took their time
i will be telling everyone i know
do not go to this place
horrible customer service
she cut me off and started insulting me
first time in a long time at the buffet
its better but still needs work
the fish was a bit dry
the cakes were a bit hard
i liked the addition of the ocean salad
the service was good !!
the site was fine
however the issue that i had was with the wifi
i called prior to arrival and spoke with dave
they were still trying to locate the culprit
we love love this placewe stayed in cabin 10
was very clean  cute & homie
i like both urban hiking and rural hiking
i still found the trails pretty interesting
trails are mostly flat  not that challenging
at the time we came  there was no bugs
most of the time  you walk along the river
i spent a least 3 hours hiking
i think we might come back for fall colour as well
it  a neat idea
went here and walked up a couple of the trails
take bug spray
this is my favourite place to hike
i love the trail that starts on twyn rivers
it  always changing as each season progresses
a great place to spend in nature
not very busy during weekdays
yeah  those were serious and hardcore issues  man
those were way simpler times
also  we were teenagers
worst experience of my entire life
shame on me for not reading the signs
they say they care
this is how much they care
http: or  or www
this is where things went terribly wrong
i called back and got bounced around an ivr
he told me to call back and push 1
that  what i did  buddy and ended up with you
no email  no phone call  nothing
really above expectations
would definitely rent from escape in the future
the bed was extremely wide & comfortable
only qualm i have about the van is it gets hot
thanks for everything mack!
all the amenities you need for comfy camping
i will definitely be using them again
we had a blast on our trip
slept very well  in fact
would definitely use the campervan again
i could not  be happier with the experience
the van was loaded with all of the essentials
cups  plates  pans  silverware  bedding
great concept and nice people
these vans make road tripping so easy
thanks for everything!
i highly recommend using escape campervan
this was a great little company to have discovered
just little stuff
highly recommend escape campervans!
the las vegas staff were very helpful
we will definitely book it again
i am  in the market for an rv
i found la mesa rv very friendly and nice
no pressure sales
i was able to walk around and look at various rvs
your staff was very friendly
your staff answered all my questions
tried again
this time i called about a unit on the website
i ask when will there be one locally to look at
"that was the only way to ""see it"""
such a major turn off
i would not  buy a $0
05 widget from these guys
prior to dropping off our fifth wheel
the service rep was craig
my recommendation is you go across the street
take your business elsewhere
ethan never gave up and he did find one
we are so happy and recommend ethan to everyone
2 hours later  no call back
"after about 15 minutes ""dominic"" called me"
he put me on hold
i thanked her & hung up
i give them zero stars!
i learned  wo not  deal with them again ever
we were greeted by salesman driving a golf cart
he was extremely rude and condescending
yes we made a wrong  turn into the service area
lost their business and ours too
call me anytime for any questions
barry scheurweghs 480-360-1864
went there to get educated about motor coaches
wish i had a better experience
ah not so fast
so you offer it to me at retail
you screwed up  it was a mistake i get it
"""sorry guys we screwed the pooch"
but nope take it or leave it
as we were leaving i realized something
yeah right
buyer beware!
he was the typical used car salesman
it makes me never want to go back to la mesa
the delivery team was amazing
while the rv is not perfect
none of that is the dealers issue
looked at the first trailer and met gabe
god bless and go titans!
before coming unglued and potential customers
please stay away from these guys!
you wo not  be disappointed
i never write bad reviews always good
never do business with these people
worst purchase of my life
i would give them negative stars if i could
awful experience that never ends with service
terrible communications
it  just not worth the hassle
their delivery and support was extremely bad
a major inconvenience and a costly trip
i would never recommend them for anything
take your business somewhere else
do not  reward their lack of integrity
i just came back from la mesa
the customer service was horrible!!!! unlike ed m
we were completely ignored
makes me wonder
too bad i ca not  give them 0 stars
00 does not  really want to move
its hard to get it in an out
now what do i do 1200
we were extremely pressured
we tried to leave several times
we finally signed a contract
mind you they were closed
it was that late by the time we left
we felt coerced
my story pretty much goes along with the rest
they were fixing numerous minor issue
never received a call in a week as promised
i was at the rv show in scottsdale
we ran into a salesman named gabe knight
he was very helpful and knowledgeable
he represented la mesa rv well!
the transaction went smoothly
we had a generator and washer and dryer installed
everyone was very nice we worked with
thank you so much
its to be expected with anything
yal did a great job
rodney and donna manis
wow!!! unbelievable the customer service there
nothing but the run around and rudeness
for what you spend there i would expect a lot more
find another place to go
if i could cancel my contact i would
still have not picked it up
it was supposed to be ready today
but no word from sales person
way to crush a dream la mesa!!!
i walked out and will take my business elsewhere
again these guys are simply clueless
one last thing
i did not  and am paying dearly for it!!
i ordered a new tiffin motorhome from here
i have not seen that to be true
next customer service is surely lacking
i had to call or text them for updates
negotiated a great deal
it was not  ready
more to come
i hope the rating and review goes up
stay tuned
just left the mesa location
we are  looking for a nice  higher end tt
the selection was poor and disorganized
we just felt like we should not  even be there
my answer  not any time soon from you
too bad  i am  a cash buyer for the right tt
we wasted ours going to la mesa rv
his response was less than helpful
""" great response for the money spent"
i trusted  and got screwed
do not  let it happen to you
la mesa lost my business
after waiting two weeks we did not get a call
guess what? no call back! big surprise
this is ridiculous
my buying experience was positive
5 stars! great buying and service experience
went in to sell our rv on wednesday at lamesa
the place we bought it at in 2008
very shady business interaction
look for another rv dealer
it will be your best option
more of the story
they were to clean it up friday
stay tuned!they delivered
the rv was fixed up as agreed
we are pleased with our purchase
i changed my rating to 3 stars
went in to look at 5th wheels back in 2012
whole different world down there
it took my cats about 30 seconds to figure it out
this is my 2nd complaint
so much for the warranty
word to wise do not  buy winnebago or fro la mesa
everyone was friendly and professional
again  another freindly staff member
just the nature of the industry i think
not enough trained techs to do all of the work
erics  customer service was above and beyond
staff was extreamly friendly
not trustworthy
now we have craig
now we have dominick
getting better
parts came in in janurary from september
but the buck stops here
brandon ivan was the best salesman ever
every one at the dealership was outstanding
mickey and angela did super jobs with finance
we waited 2
otherwise
bought a winnebago back in september
pleasant experience and a good price
sales process very pleasant
bought a used tiffin in mesa az
had numerous things to be fixed
it has been 1 month and still no response
if you want good service in n
attempted to get service on our 2007 allegro bus
so i gave up
on to the good review: lamesa rv
so i went there the following day
i told him i wanted to think about it
he said i would have to leave a $500
"00 deposit so i did ""100% refundable"""
karl said sure  so i did
i walked back in to the showroom  karl was busy
so ian the store manager took over
five hours at camping world
i hope the experience keeps going like this
i will update this review after i receive the rv
thank you  karl  ian  and lori
we too would give a lower star if possible
so buyer beware!
i young man was very helpful and not pushy at all
thank you
i did get a lot of brochures though
we stopped by on a saturday afternoon
it really is too bad considering their inventory
this review is for the service dept only
i have not purchased from the sales department
he told us it would be ready the next day
we will never return to this dealership
went to la mesa rv to get a quote on the repair
sorry  no deal
it definitely wont be la mesa rv
take your business elsewhere
told him my budget was around 30k
i will  take my 30k cash elsewhere
very nice fellow
he did the things we asked of him
he was super-good
i recommend him
net  he was wonderful
he even drove it for us
he was so patient  so nice  so friendly
he was on the ball
that was enough; we bought elsewhere
they also post not responsible for items taken
how convenient for them
i had my oman generator serviced by this company
rats got into the generator box after a month
thanks a lot la mesa
never going back to them again
make sure they did the work you asked for
you may have a bad surprise like i did
never go back
lamesa in a nutshell
1) anything the service dept tells you is a lie
we bought a brand new vilano from lamesa
we arrived and were met with blank stares
our new rig was not  ready
it was a disaster
halfway through  he gave up
from there it went completely downhill
hard to imagine but true
i have  never seen such incompetence in my life
they also did a horrible job detailing our rig
no more black feet and socks
four months later  i stand by my review
your service department is a pathetic joke
lance kept us updated during the whole process
charles & vicki brooks
good prices and initial service good
they are awesome
bought our rv two weeks ago
should have read the reviews before going there
but the rest of that place is the worst
but it really is not  worth the headache
just stay away
over promise  under deliver
like the car industry  cash&dash dealership
the sliding door  use caution
winnebago revel: made only for men
really like this vehicle; however
no thought in the design
ripped off
do not do biz with these people
i should have  run away but i did not
even with all that it  still not done
the list grows every time i have  used it
this is a brand new unit
listen to my warning
stay away!!!!!!
has been very attentive to our question so far
we had anticipated having to return
it was taken care of while we waited
there was not a magazine to read
there is a cooler wit bottled water
there is a popcorn machine
i am happy we went to lamesa rv
kudos to la mesa rv!!
we are first-time rv buyers
like a slimy used car lot  but worse
never again  and highly not recommended!!
brandon was very professional
i lost my entire muffler or exhaust this morning
i tried out rainbow muffler because it  nearby
the price to install my parts was very affordable
the service was great
my original quote was by the hour pricing
renters beware!  we are pretty easy-going people
fair enough
ok  these things happen
6 hours later
this made us double check the fire extinguisher
it expired years ago
mike gave us the clear to call roadside service
roadside service finally came 24 hours later
so gross
we never received a response
we called multiple times
no returned calls
we highly recommend sticking to rv share
deal directly with an owner
they ignored subsequent phone calls after that
"we are out our deposit as ""they have no assets"""
great service and friendly staff
thank you brian  josh  charlie and staff
josh was great to work with
replaced a defective fuel sending unit
charles was our tech
a real pro
we stayed in our coach while they did the work
this is the place to go for spartan service
i ordered a utility trailer from this company
straight forward approach to sales
ranted a trailer for camping
they do not  try to nickel and dime you
i would recommend jackssons!
in the construction field  overbuilt is better
i moved my whole house with their trailers
way cheaper than u-haul
also  it was a little on the more expensive side
it might be worth a try!
first time visit
accommodations are great
nice shade and great folks running the place
shower houses and the grounds are impeccable
we found the campground immaculate
will go back
stay far away if you can thank you
this is how you take care of customers
this is how a business should operate
these guys are amazing
give them a try and you will  see what i mean
decatur blvd
las vegas  nv 89102
so it looks like i need a new starter
good man who cares about his work
scott and his team again fixed one of my sons cars
we cannot say enough about scott and his crew
amazing service
i needed a new water pump
the job was completed on time at a fair price
ask for scott
keep my 2005 chrysler running like a charm
cause i am  just nurse this baby another year
great service and honest people
great customer care
give him a shot you wo not  be disappointed
i will not take any of my trucks   anywhere else
scott took great care of me and my car
scott is a great mechanic and honest
he has repaired my vehicles for years
scott and the business he runs is incredible
thank you scott and crew
thank you for getting me back out on the road!
i recommend this shop!
other than a jump or tow
very professional and i would highly recommend
scott was great
thanks again scott!
then i turned to yelp and found monaghan
customer for life
thank you!
scott was very helpful
he said to come in first thing in the morning
great service and peoplds
took my infiniti g35 in for overheating issues
he is a master at what he does
great job!!!
scott is so nice and honest
go here for great service!!!!
these guys are top notch
great place
loved the service
will come back! ask for scott or mike
scott is a hell of a guy
worth every dollar
go to scott!adam
scott is a true professional
thanks again
first off  the owner or manager  scott
do not  go to this place  they are scams
so i called cops and they came took the car
be careful people from this shop
hands down the best auto shop in vegas
highly recommend
it turns out i was very wrong
the initial price quoted was $1700 to fix
excellent mechanic service
took my truck in
highly recommend
engine code indicates problem with some cam part
the cam timing is off
belts are good
they give crooked mechanics a bad name
fast  honest  helpful people
thank you for the brakes
i was quoted a price of $946
he says it runs great
i get there and get my bill and it  $1 500
just kills me bc i felt this was an honest shop
that is being dishonest and shady
customer beware
no one could get us in  except monaghan
no one had it
so scott and my husband both started searching
thank you for getting us back on the road!
completely dishonest mechanics
if you want quality that  how it works
""" rude and deceptive"
i know my own car and these were not there prior
stayed during stampede week
green lots  nice trees growing
clean updated bathrooms
little pool for fun with the kids  not too cold
we will  come again
they were outdated and felt dirty
i will be back here next year for sure
since i know rv repair needs are a given
do not  go anywhere else they are the best
the sites are beautiful and relaxing
this used to be yogi bears jellystone park
it changed its name last summer
gone are the bears and other cartoon characters
bath houses and restrooms are clean
themed weekends are fun
the gift shop and ranger station is woeful
the arts and crafts activities are lame as well
the miniature golf course needs help
we found this place and it is amazing
the lake is amazing  the pool is beautiful
they offer free lessons
just had a nice weekend here
camped in a pop-up with wife & kids
saturday was better
will be back  great close to home family get away
but we will be back
this is a big  and nice campground
just very noisy all around
wonder why the staff is not  enforcing policies
great camping experience
the campground offers so much to do
it is very family or kid friendly
our site was larger than most campgrounds offer
the bathrooms were very clean
the price was good  staff friendly & helpful
i ca not  wait to go back again
nice place marred by the little things
"they call themselves a ""resort""  i do not  agree"
below is a summarized pros & cons
very clean facility and free breakfast everyday
beautiful views of the mountains
phenomenal office staff
great park!
the best rv resort in az
this camp ground has a lot of seasonal people
most are retired and living here
it  kind of like staying in a sr
living community
no campfires
however my cable did not work
on the fort mcdowell indian reservation
i did not appreciate that at all
it  also quiet
the people were pleasant
good central location for mayo clinic  or phoenix
casino across road
it  like a slap in the face
you will be kicked out
showers were 'fairly' clean
there are also no pull throughs
i had to unhook everything and back in
awkward for a single person
pool and spa is nice as is laundry area
also has a nice community room
would highly recommend and will stay here again
full hook up  level sites
we were fortunate to get a spot at this park
we were pleased with this rv park
i look forward to visiting again
we had plenty of room
the pool is very refreshing as is the hot tub
we will gladly return when coming to vegas again
do not  be fooled  a good place to stay
location: check
weather: check
shade: check
price: check
here for the first of four nights
dog bags are provided
pool and spa open 24 hours  at least for now
i might stay again
tina is friendly and welcoming
well  this rv park is kinda creepy
karen  the park manager was nice
worst place ever
so unprofessional
no wonder they got bought out
we will  be back here to stay again for sure
if there was a zero star i would have picked it
beware ~ poor or no service
warranty work
now this was not the only problem
there are other items left on done
to be fair there were a few items that they fixed
we will  see if they hold
it does not  matter we will never go back there
i live full time in my travel trailer
sam was excellent
he finally decided on jayco
he went into wwrv and spoke w or greg pope
he said greg was very knowledgeable
we purchased a brand-new 2015 motorcoach
they installed event on my roof with my purchase
stay very far away from this place
it  a wonder that they are  still in business
thank you leslie for all your help!!!
very friendly but that  where it ends
dealer prep was not done
cabinet hardware loose and stripped
water heater temp regulator not functioning
toilet paper holder fell off the wall
kitchen faucet leaks
"the response?  ""well  it  a man-made product"
bring it in
everything went well
so happy!
top notch place for online business
friendly staff all around
their prices for shipping are a bit steep though
we were greeted by cordell secrist
no pressure or pushiness
these folks have destroyed our rv
we took it in for warranty work in 2016
it took over 2 months
are you starting to see a pattern here
we fixed it
it  almost been two years
they informed me it  out of warranty
i have  never seen anything like this before
this is disgusting i ca not  even sell it
i am  not writing this to be vindictive
find a reputable dealer
wish i could give a negative star rating
my wife still cannot stop talking about it
that was my thinking anyway
everybody was knowledgeable and friendly
i was not  given that choice
that  bad business practice
not jayco
please check your spare tire before you leave
please be aware
love these guys
i have  dealt with them several times
leslie  taking care of her customers
or can get it! great service
glad to have them around
that was february 6th 2018
this is a 39 ft coach
do not  be stupid like me and buy from world wide
i am not an idiot like they wanted to think i am
time to get an attorney
they are a bunch of crooks
sick of their run-a-round
i should give zero stars for this place
the work that they did do was sub par
i ordered a part   for my pop up camper
i was elated as i really needed this piece
i thought
00 for shipping!!! unbelievable
82 bucks to ship a 10
00 item??? i was robbed!
they wont return a phone call
but wont even return my phone call
please stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!
the sales guy was frantic and rude
we were told he was fired  but it was a lie
""" bill was forced to apologize as his punishment"
no call back again
this is grounds for immediate termination
buyer beware!!!
the sales department was great
we should have known this was too good to be true
we had to wait two hours for our walkthrough
the walkthrough really was not  that great
i also feel like mark f  i was sold a lemon
they have  been in business over 40 years
i purchased an aluma trailer from these folks
excellent service and fantastic product
thanks hitchen' post for coming through again
we always appreciate doing business with u
i just got hitched at the hitchin' post
i bought an 8
i figured i would give it a try
i also say once again  thanks!!!
i went in to buy a horse trailer
filthy  cluttered reception area
too much junk around to reach the brochures
if you want it  buy it
if you do not  want it  do not  buy it
i do not  care
"he said ""no  absolutely no"
"what salesperson says ""i do not  care"" ?"
i do not  want your service
i did not ask for help selling my vehicle
i want a buyer
seller networks contacted me about selling my car
scamming company
say a lot good stuff but never deliver
i signed up with this company in oct
they do not screen anything  that is a load of
nothing!!!!  i am sooo pissed off
this place is a scam
this was in february
it is now april 17th
i have  never heard back from them
i too  paid and posted in january
i love how guys do this to women
if i could give zero stars i would
it  been over a year and absolutely nothing!!
my complaint is pretty much the same as mar c
and roger e
sounds good right? total scam
good luck if your vehicle gets sold in 10 years
this is a bait and switch
it wo not  happen
do not  do it
the bbb should shut this company down
avoid them and save your money
however  i greatly regret spending $299
00 for their awful service
they do not  try to help you at all
do not  sign up with them  block their number
do not  pay for this scam
what an abysmal way of doing business
i work in sales at a car dealership
you are better off trying other means!
seller networks is a total scam
i listed my car through them on march 8th
so it smells of total scam
please do not  be fooled by them
i wasted $300 but you can stay away from them
well  i should have  checked yelp first
i ca not  believe i got so suckered
i posted on craigslist and got about 10-15 calls
i signed up with these guys and got zero
i mean  not 1 lead  not 1 call
i wrote to them several times asking for a refund
i suggest you do the same
this is a complete joke
stay away
i was screwed just like everyone else
it is what i recommend everyone else do as well
this is a total internet scam
their sites are fake or no-name sites
com but they do not
stay away
i was called by seller networks at 7pm
very unprofessional
this so called service is a joke
"awful ""set up"""
thank you all for saving me some money
i am sorry you were taken
karma will get them
stay far away from these crooks
pressure sale
sleazy  rude and inappropriate selling tactics
waste of time and money
total bs stay away!
"00 to ""help you sell"" your car"
************fraud alert************
what a worthless company
pay them $300 and nothing
i would not recommend this company to anyone
"i don""t want to give them even 1 star"
as they have done on a previous review
3 weeks later  nothing
stay away!!
scam! run!
their tactics are unethical and rude
basically just because of this business practice
this type of activity is completely unacceptable
this company should be prosecuted
they lied again
what a crappy company
seller networks for cars is a scam
biggest ripoff going
worst customer service
these folks will contact you
you do all of the work
i have heard nothing
just hang up the phone and block the number
they will call again and again
that is how they got me
it  a lie
i am  not a customer
but  i was solicited by this joke of a company
this review is a bit of a test
they publish classified ads and websites
do not waste your money on this service
i am  upgrading seller  networks from 1 star to 3
i declined which resulted in an unhappy closer
i then sold it the same day
do not use these people
this company is a total scam
it was easily two hours
they stayed after to accommodate our late arrival
we are very happy and will be back
they have a lot of rv  and park them close
the staff is super nice  polite and friendly
the facility is very clean and secure
check out their ups store
we had a huge issue a couple days later
on sunday  they are closed
i explained to her what happened
she was so helpful
monday mornings are very busy at her location
thanks debbie!!
thanks  guys
great location  great facility  and great staff
wow!  debbie the manager runs a tight ship
the rv storage is fantastic
i love this place
good job!
we had stopped in around 7-8 moths ago
the staff was rude as could be
we got put on a waiting list for a all year site
very unprofessional
nice grounds  we did the primitive camping
check-in or out was easy
i would  stay again for the price
very nice setup
clean showers and bathrooms
great for rvs
friendly staff
easy to navigate
the cabins look cute
nicely located near restaurants  fuel and shops
we stayed here for 2
we loved our time there
the staff was so nice and accommodating
friendly staff
other than that very happy with my stay here!
other than that great clean camp ground
the staff is very nice and helpful
the pool is very nice and well kept
very pet friendly
went camping for a friend  birthday
i was shocked
we asked for an explanation and they gave none
totally rude behavior by the staff
quiet time is at 10pm and it was not  even 9:30
this was the most difficult to locate our site
then even more difficult to find the bathroom
avoid this place at all costs
very hard to find in dark spaces close together
cable and wifi
beautiful lake
seemed ok for the night
update on the bedbugs in cabins story
still no sign of my money back
koa hq is no help
wtf??? really turnoff number 2
slight turnoff though
turn off 3
like do that when nobody is checked in
we give up on tv and just decide time to sleep
soooo for sure negative stars
wtf??? really turnoff number 2
slight turnoff though
turn off 3
like do that when nobody is checked in
we give up on tv and just decide time to sleep
soooo for sure negative stars
cleanest koa we have ever stayed at
office staff was wonderful
pool exceptionally clean
"""  this is a huge safety issue"
i will not be staying at this koa again
spots to close together internet is spotty at best
if you can get on at all
other than no internet
would we stay here again? no
great rv park
are well maintained
they are pet and child friendly
close to shopping  movies  etc
we have stayed here many times
this visit was a bit challenging
made rsvp a month in advance
we did not have to move
over the easter holiday office was closed
they started a daily activity program also
this is our 5th stay here   in 2 years
very nice park
clean  friendly  and scenic
has a nice walking path and large sites
the entire place was immaculate and well run
it  a family owned and operated business
we usually stay during spring training
to catch some games and golf
its 5 stars all the way
big pull through spaces
the employees are friendly
but the park allows kids and dogs
there is a big dip at the curb
you could rip your sewer pipe or jacks right off
be very very careful
nice place for an overnight stay
especially enjoyed the dog wash
kids had fun at the playground
quick stay but met our expectations
very friendly and accomadating staff
park is super clean  quiet  and friendly
lots of doggies and nice doggie parks
laundry a tad pricey
easy drive to shopping and restaurants
we would stay here again
this park is meticulously maintained
it has the feel of being out in the desert
the noise associated is barely noticeable
they have a good sized laundry facility as well
the closest place is a 30 minute walk
they will not be getting my money any longer
the place is ok  but the staff is atrocious
00 per night in the description of this park
the grounds were clean
older and kept up
people were friendly
we will not be going back
we stayed here for a month this season
also 2 washers out of service
there  a small fitness room in this area as well
we plan to return
park is kept clean and is quiet
staff is friendly
the old people rule the park
nice rv park
second time we have  stayed there
liked it better in the winter
pulled  in after hours; no power to my site
had to find an after hours staff
ended up just moving to another site
friendly staff
a good location while visiting phoenix
the staff is extremely friendly an nice
worse service experience
batteries were completely dead
not cheap
i could not  believe what i was hearing
it was not  too low
do not  buy from this place
they are the worst place you could go
actions speak louder than words
do not  waste your time with la mesa  bull
consumer beware they sell you  junk
but their customer service is junk
we bought a motorhome from them in october
do not buy from them
our sales team was awesome
it  now jan 17th
service falls flat on it  face
i want to like this dealership
i want to be able to refer friends here
i just ca not
the service end of things is simply terrible
do not purchase from this vendor
not one individual has contacted us in any manner
not even close! buyers beware
we waited  and waited and waited
we spent about 15-20 minutes waiting
process went fairly smooth
left a voice mail but again  no return call
lamesa rv sucks!! never again
overall a great experience with this dealer
do not do service with me-mo!!! terrible
nice enough guy but nice does not  cut it
never returns a phone call
anyway  guess what it blew
fridge out again
well friday came and they never came to change it
monday came and they never came to change it
now it  been almost 2 weeks and no fridge
that was not her place to lecture me
i am not happy
they sales guy was super pushy
and the finance guy was extremely rude
we took our business elsewhere
i would never recommend this place to anyone
the finance manager is rude and insulting
too bad there are so many other places to go
we tried them because they are new
keep it up  boys
going elsewhere
its not just this location
its company wide!  all the locations
its really sad
i truly hate this place
you will pay dearly when it come to service
it will cost you in the long run
we purchased a rv at their big sale in february
we were promised our 5th wheel to be ready by 3 p
on sighing of final papers
a very dissatisfied customer
vickie g from sd
i would not go anywhere else
25% less than they promised
these guys are a disgrace
save thousands shop else where
we purchased an rv at a show
took it back when the stereo came in
cd  keep getting kicked out
i asked to see the handwritten paperwork
he did not  have it
and he was not  willing to produce it
we signed a contract  agreeing to the price
the other repairs needed were as follows:1
water heater leak
i responded negatively both times again
everything on the list had been addressed
john went above and beyond
he is a sales person at la mesa rv
he was considerate and took care of our problem
rate to find nowadays
i would give them negative stars if i could
they closed at 6pm this day
we arrived at 4:30pm
i have  done my research
i do not  appreciate know-it-alls
this salesman was with the company for 19 years
this has been my worst experience in buying an rv
this was all to be scheduled
we were then rushed off to finance
102 point inspection is a joke
i would not buy from this dealer ever again
please listen to my words
stay away!!!!!!
salesman micky hammond was outstanding
our rv tech cole did a fantastic job
fantastic job
thank you dennis & sharon hulbert
they are all still safe and alive at la mesa rv
la mesa rv cares about one thing: selling rvs
the phone just rings
there are real people that work there  some where
with that said
it had been worn completely thorough to the wire
it was not  like that at the rv show
or they did and just did not  care
we wo not  purchase from them again
customer service is so dysfunctional
we made the deal
after service was horrible as well
our sales rep was alex
they shipped it to our house as promised
none have been available in our area to date
we were taken to an office and left there
after 10 min
my husband got so frustrated he walked out
they had the unit all hooked up and leveled
took a bit of google research and time wasted
there was fluid all over by the fluid container
this would be a great feature if it was true
from that time we were completely ignored
i never received one return call from service
00 per month down payment of $2 500
00 after my wife took it out for test drive
then they said ok to run credit report
00 down payment up to about $4500
had to put $500
i could not  be any happier with my experience
i appreciate your service
outstanding service!!!
we purchased a toyhauler from la mesa rv
at the time of purchase the service was fine
do not  bother with this place
well now i know why they have 1 and a half stars
where to begin
they had it til april
damages the body and put hole in dash
i have photos to prove it
did not  repair everything on the list of items
had a survey on the phone
lady said corporate would be calling me
never go there you will be sorry!
never again
we purchased a toyhauler from la mesa rv
at the time of purchase the service was fine
do not  bother with this place
it would be a less than star if possible
lots  and lots of craftsmanship issues
extremely poor quality thor product
even if it  brand new and has a warranty
hmmmmmnow about the service department
whatever you do do not  accept him
he is a liar
he never follows through with anything
now  for the cool part
i had a mixed bag experience at la mesa rv
fyi - we live 1500 miles away
a month later we flew out to pick it up
i corrected him and we moved on
angelo is the sales manager
we were brand new to learning about rv
we have had our rig since september 2017
do your service somewhere else
well now i know why they have 1 and a half stars
where to begin
they had it til april
damages the body and put hole in dash
i have photos to prove it
did not  repair everything on the list of items
had a survey on the phone
lady said corporate would be calling me
was on a trip and started getting dark
i had no headlights
got to destination and checked under hood
they never plugged them into the electric harness
i can and will go on and on
hands down the best transaction
everyone was so nice
even got freshly baked cookies
what a great team
thank you
everyone was exemplary
i will  pass
worst customer service i have ever gotten
i purchased a new $100 000 plus rv
it has tons of problems
my phone messages and emails are not returned
this is unacceptable
will be posting daily until we we this resolved
awful customer service and no accountability
beware going through this company
i would avoid at all costs
do not buy from la mesa rv
horrible customer service
they smoke and have filthy mouths
this is not okay especially around my children
he was great
very knowledgeable and patient with us
mcdowell rd  phoenix
purchased a used rv from them
i can recommend bill as your next rv sales person
they did not really have either
for that afterwards
so  they took him to an office room to do this
arrived on 8
15 out of ohio
overall i will spend my money elsewhere
so any way  camping world can suck it
overall i will spend my money elsewhere
do not  go here for service
poor communication
they dont fix it
really bad
this shop is great in many ways
i am very picky with repairs to my vehicle
paint job was flawless  all parts align perfectly
they went way over and beyond what was expected
it looks better than when it was brand new
and their service was very polite as well
you definitely will not regret your decision
this place is an absolute joke
he told me it will be done friday morning
go at your own risk
this place is amazing
not being taken advantage iof
that was almost 3 years ago
thank you ash from one big party bus
i really appreciate your honesty on my ac unit
so my guess was incorrect after all
the tech ran a power wire and that was that
there must be faster service somewhere
very rude
front desk not knowledgeable
you will regret it!
i like it here  not much drama
lengthy but worthy review
the crime rate is very low
neighbors are friendly
pet- and family-friendly community
it was never inconvenient
great location to live  easy freeway aceess
we are not allowed to use any of that
just a pool and an exercise room
that  complete bull
so i called mrs
i cannot make up phone records
i have proof
this is such an awful thing to do to someone
you are  the best
i highly recommend the apr rv team
we just bring itin and say call us when it  done
always taken care of with a smile
apr did an excellent job repairing my toy hauler
mine was an insurance claim
apr rv was very professional throughout my repair
this is a very honest and professional business
hope my review helps someone
apr has gained a customer for life
do not  take your rv anywhere else for repairs
great service  friendly and great work!!
now what???  is a lifetime less than 4 years???
our family joined the jcc 2 months ago
family here is a priority
"""great class instructors who know their specialty"
facilities are clean and well-maintained
""" that says it all"
excellent equipment and staff
i only wish their weekend hours were better
the evenings   but i like both crowds
i will try the classes and the pool as well
in the morning there is no need to bring your own
my son did preschool here
good experience
he does winter and summer camps there now
nice facility
friendly people
if it is your thing  you will  be well covered!
very rude customer service
not happy about this at all
the jcc is a staple of the cleveland-area
and of course a certified yoga instructor
just pay a bit more than regular members
no one is preaching in your ears while exercising
friendly staff
this is very important
i gotta say
i really love this place
the machines are state of art
the staff is very friendly
i agree  this club is a best kept secrete
i love the jcc
anyway  great place and i am  glad i joined there
no one ever returned their calls
it  just unacceptable
there is no excuse not to
it  really sad
weekends close at 6pm
i like the pool
that was really fun  and low stress
we had such a great experience with elite rv
walked use through the rv
is was clean  comfortable and easy to drive
it made our girls trip even better
i highly recommend elite rv
it was a 2016 leprechaun
we were 5 hrs away without cell service
just beware when renting with them
they look good on paper & at a good price
just remember  you get what you pay for
prep fee is just money in their pocket
a fast walk around & you are out of there
then there  nathen
you will thank yourself!
the cost came in less than the estimate
our vehicle performs better than ever
we highly recommend them for any of their work
took my 5th wheel to have bearings packed
very knowledgable and honest
they have earned my future business
good group of guys
thank you
if you want more information call them!!
the work was do not  proper and very fast
these guys know how to treat customers!!a++
i will recommend these guys to everyone!!!!!!
it  time to give straight line their due
if i could  i would  give straight line 6 stars
great service from mike today
5 to 6 x 5
straight line had the parts
i will be back
this was truly a great experience
bait and switch warning!!
we also contracted them to install a rear ladder
patti and dave are an awesome team!
very pleasant experience
best rv dealer in arizona
thank you for looking out for me not just the $
this place is a rip off
be aware
these people are trying to steal your money
this place stands far apart from the others
jed was so knowledgeable and friendly and helpful
the follow up service is top notch
picked it up a week later and got it back home
no charge!! just great service from great people
appreciate all you did!!
"there are no add-ons like ""dealer prep"""
you pay the taxes and registration
jed knows his shit
so does jed
he showed us a variety of rv  that we liked
thirty more minutes and we were talking prices
amazingly  still no pressure
we dropped the deposit that day
you will not be disappointed
this place is great
the scavenger hunt is the best
and that made it so fun!  great destination!
it was a great bounding experience
heritage  hayride is longer
there was only one slide
the straw tunnel is very minimalistic
and too dark
no comparison with patterson  straw playground
would love
it  so charming and well done
they sell burgers and dogs on premises
you are surrounded by them at the campsites
we heard coyotes and owls at night
absolutely the most disgusting rv i have ever seen
their response was that it had been winterized
best cruise america location i have  been to yet!
no empathy  no apology  just a $100 credit
many thanks to ww williams  we will be back
bill myers enterprises
do not  even try !!!!group of liars
try to avoid them in any price !
a good experience from start to finish
would highly recommend
they sure know how to throw parts though
ridiculous  worthless business
save yourself a lot of money  and a headache
go somewhere else
we had such a good rapport with jared
there was an apology and the holes were filled in
you cant see the holes  but i know they are there
we had a great experience with johnnie walker rv
my wife hates camping
wanted to mention that
but seeing that rv changed me
she too enjoyed gazing at them in awe
glamp? ugh  you get the picture
i have an audi q7 that can tow up to 6 600
next up was findlay
i was frustrated
i seriously was about to give up
i pulled in having no idea who they were
they seriously go above and beyond in every way
i am not exaggerating
go see jj and he will take incredible care of you
these people care about you
these are my friends
stopped in yesterday to pick up a part for our rv
for hubby  any size rv is easy
hubby really liked his manner  too
johnny walkers is a unique experience
mark in sales was excellent
thank you everyone at johnnie walker rv!
very impressed
"the ""impressed"" ended there"
""" again  shocked"
she practically threw us off the lot
what an amazing place for service
trust them at anytime
43 country coach
thank you guys !!!
never ever ever will i buy here again
so dissapointed
yes  last year
they had the parts and gave them to me
quite friendly people
will come back here without hesitation
very disappointed
i started talking about what my parents had
well that company was bought out by winnebago
add that to the report you kept telling me about
we showed back up
that was 2 days ago
have not  heard a word
i am  tired of awful customer service
i am excited to go camping this weekend!
no shady math here
we love our new north trail!
we came from tucson
saved a fortune from a dealer in tucson
everyone we dealt with at jw was great
i would  like to give then ten stars!!!!
great job!
amazing service
i wish car buying was as simple as this
i would definitely use them again
if your buying an rv do not  go anywhere else
these folks are always the best
they fixed my hot water tank and my refrigerator
i will be back
three times
the staff here has become our extended family
this is not a resort or heck raising park
overall  i have really loved 9920 apartments
there is no genuine concern for residents
we ended up moving to a town house in glendale
sadly they look down at everyone
love living at theses apartments
very friendly and safe quiet  neighborhood
can not complain
very clean too
the staff are great
i even get water offered everytime i go
they fixed the problem in no time
they say dog friendly
stay away!!
it  unsafe now swat teams coming in to raid apt
amenities and good people to serve you
we enjoyed this place
never had an issue receiving mail here
hands down  best campground in vegas
everyone was so nice and helpful
they keep it very clean and maintained
we also felt very secure
i ca not  wait to come back!
nice place to stay for the price
the lots are spacious! very nice place!
they offer quite a lot of discounts
this place has it all with great prices
thank you cee cee!
park is very clean
staff is friendly
karaoke  bar and store all good
pool questionable
not my fav
vegas is hot in summer; too hot for my dogs
great place to stay
world needs more people like him
large  very over-crowded
very little open space  not dog friendly
rude and confrontational management
bathrooms seemed clean
this is a really nice park
we have eaten breakfast here everyday
99?  the hook ups are great
the wifi has been excellent
i have  seen them come up to the camp spots
it would have cost $10 to park
we definitely like staying here
i came here for a wedding and it was quite nice
beautiful rv resort
clean and well maintained
i am not going to inconvenience myself any linger
4 of us in my new to me motorhome
we all had different meals
all in all  a clear recommendation!
love the staff and all the friendly people here
great security of the entrance and grounds
there are laundry rooms in several locations
well maintained and manicured
i have  rv park
no one was alerted and no one said anything to me
however  when i did my rv had a smell of sewer
we check in when it  102 outside
what the heck are they thinking
and the space they put us is all concrete
there were grass spots all around
then the dog area is ricks
how do you walk in hot rocks
good water pressure and hot water
one area is not  lit at all at night
we really enjoyed our time here
no issues with the wifi either
we plan to return early next year!
very friendly and seems very clean and secure
this is the 2nd time we have been here
this place is nice
very clean and friendly
they have two pools which one is adult only
also a hot tub
nice store and easy check in
very close to the strip
yes you hear planes
if you are in vegas you will hear planes
it was not annoying
i will be back
definitely will be back to stay
we just got home from a week stay at the oasis
we had a deluxe site
we would definitely go back for another visit!
very nice park
stayed for 7 nights in late may
the park is very clean including thed restrooms
the service there is more than wonderful
we enjoyed our stay here
we never had to wait to use them
we did not notice any pet issues
huge  loud and smellythis place is clean
the dog area is big and underused
99 per day
water pressure in the shower is not so great
advertises free internet but there is no internet
we were only there two days so just gave up on it
what a great place to rv camp
friendly staff
friendly neighbors
clean pools
clean restrooms
clean facilities throughout
but that is just fine with me
i left my 20  behind years ago
the facility has 1 adult and 1 family pool
both are attached to the main building
both have gates for security too
it was cleaned and manicured daily
yes it was raked every morning
check-out and check-in times are very reasonable
noon and 1pm respectively
a bit expensive but a really good resort
ca not  fault it
facilities all work
wifi free but very congested
intermittently unusable
would pay extra for good internet access
they should offer that
stayed one night on our way to utah
the site was level and the staff was friendly
cant beat the price on a saturday night
the do have a convenience store and supplies
i would stay there again
extremely pet friendly
forget all that negative writing they posted
because believe you me they are not
and i will never get that back
so do not  ever think they do a good job
and they do not  hesitate to rip you off big time
2nd time staying here
super clean facilities
helpful and friendly staff
good security
the pool area was so much fun
nice and level flat cement
no dinner
great family stop
will be here again
this is a nice park
a bit set away from the happening strip
the dog park was nice for those with canines
beautiful rv park perfect for visiting vegas
it  a legit oasis
great hidden gem
in all my years never knew this was here
truly feel like you are  in paradise!!
very disappointed
did not  take long to find out why
the bathrooms are individual rooms with showers
there is also a nice laundry area
there is also a workout room
the pools are nice
one for adults and one for the family
laundry facilities are available
employees are friendly and that  always a plus
check this place out on your way by
you will  love it! i do
beautiful resort - there is no denying that
for a resort this upscale and expensive
i expect both from the employees
they have a beautiful rose garden and fountain
what a great place to rv camp
friendly staff
friendly neighbors
clean pools
clean restrooms
clean facilities throughout
but that is just fine with me
i left my 20  behind years ago
the facility has 1 adult and 1 family pool
both are attached to the main building
both have gates for security too
it was cleaned and manicured daily
yes it was raked every morning
check-out and check-in times are very reasonable
noon and 1pm respectively
this is vegas you would expect it to work!!
park is well organized and clean
very nice rv park! very clean and paved sites
fancy rv resort
pull thru and backup sites
lovely park but bad customer service
oasis rv park has set the standard high
a friend recommended this resort to us
clean  safe  well maintained
and great signage at the entrance
the resort is not downtown
exit 33 on i-15 south is the location
two shopping centers nearby
lsa vegas blvd
as far as rv parks in las vegas this is the best
two huge pools and jacuzzi
one pool is a family pool another 18 and older
the cafe has the best pancakes ever
ask what the secret ingredient is
this rv park is among the worst in the country
theft is rampant
management is dishonest
first  extortion
that is oasis rv park
very nice rv park
this time we made the decision to stay
pulled into the site with no problem
the site was clean and level on a concrete pad
the kids loved the pool
this is a great rv park! check in and out was easy
we will be back
we traveled in a 25 foot travel trailer
a very nice and well run park
manager is especially helpful
a great place to stay for an affordable rate!
the cafe and store are clean and convenient
it has a close proximity to the strip
would i recommend this park? absolutely
would we come back? absolutely
informational: we travel in a 36' class a rv
outstanding rv park
definitely a place i would come back to
not too far from the strip
evening is nice and peaceful
restaurant was nice for morning breakfast
almost like a hotel check in style
best money i have spend yet at an rv resort
keep the good work up guys
it  amazing
we have been staying here for the last 4 months
the bath house hot water needs addressed
reported at least twice a week
reported on several occasions
sprinkler system comes on and floods our site
reported on numerous occasions
several pieces of gym equipment does not work
stayed for the night
nice clean restrooms and a beautiful pool
called the place and they found it
thank u so much!  it was an heirloom
2014 adventurer with tow
very nice park
nice safety feature
upon registering  you go to your site
we have pets so you need to use the pet areas
they also have a restaurant from 7:30to 2:30
about 3miles from the new hotels
we uber to fremont at 18 bucks
would stay again
it  also very secure
we will stay here again for sure!
definitely a good place to stay!
this was a nice clean place to stay!  very quiet
"definitely avoid this ""resort"""
spaces are very close to each other
were a party of four rv s
we are very displeased
management can
do nothing to mitigate this mix-up
watch out for this place!
spotless laundry and bathrooms very nice staff
thank you to all of you for the nice stay
no one bothers anyone
it is very clean and lots of activities
pet area is small and there were a lot of pets
i usually cringe having to go to the tire store
these guys were fast and professional
to top it off  everyone was friendly
we definitely found out new tire store
bret referred us to phoenix tire on w buckeye rd
the wrote up an estimate for 941
the estimate stated there were 3 items to fix
i got a second estimate for 250
be careful of them
thank you to dj for referring us
i could go on and on
but i am  getting annoyed just thinking about it
these people are incompetent and dishonest
however  alberto was great
he said have fun  so i did
wake up  sandra
every single one  except for bates
every single one  except for bates
many  if not all  of the rv  are owned by others
honesty is not in their vocabulary
"however  the scooters went ""missing"""
first off  i would  just like to thank tim
i will be coming back
automotive history:  i do all my automotive work
he was thorough and honest
first off i called 7 mobile mechanics
my 7th call was to jeffs auto & truck repair
but jeff actually knows what he is doing
a huge thank you to jeff
you sir are the real deal
quality work but over priced significantly
do business with again
the price i was quoted was exactly what i paid
they clearly care about their customers
plus their prices cannot be beat
consider me a super satisfied customer
this place is awesome
ryan came out and did a quick fantastic job
great job guys!
the manager showed up and was nice and helpful
access roads to the sites are narrow
there are no pull-throughs
no tv hook ups and very slow internet connection
great rv park with good people and activities
like new bathroom or showers  good pool & spa
i wish good sam noted that on their app
this was our second and last stay!
we have absolutely no complaints whatsoever
the staff were friendly and check in was quick
the staff was friendly  helpful and knowledgeable
the rv site was clean and roomy
stayed here 4 nites after readinb positive reviews
we encountered many friendly folks
the rv site was large
other than that large jacuzzis and pools
it was very good
we were in site b120 and we traveled with 2 dogs
we would stay here again
i was impressed with the customer service here
they have activities and social clubs here
there is a nice café in the clubhouse
they helped us hook up our rv
the park is well maintained and clean
there is free cable and wifi
this is a nice place to stay
i am  glad we found it
very nice park  clean and well kept
work out room at the pool was a bonus
very nice park
staff is professional  available and helpful
parking spots are nice and easy in or out
facilities maintained well and clean
they keep the dog parks clean and tidy
this park is convenient to grocery store
we are  going back next year
note: this is not a big rig friendly r v park
maybe 30' rv  or trailers
"the ""one star"" applies to big rigs only"
they even followed up with me
call them! this is the way business should be done
best price and best quality tires
2 brothers that own the business
do great work  great pricing always fair
get it done fast
always done on time
what a gem  tucked away on macdonald
i will return
price was great as well  very fair
called these guys looking for an axle hub
they were knowledgeable and helpful
friendly  professional  knowledgeable
great service
much appreciated!
so clean and well placed
all wiring done perfectly and no issues at all
thanks guys!
thank you tony and nick
took our rv in for warranty work
had to wait 3 weeks to get in
dale was so great at my walk through
we ca not  say enough about this company
i ca not  say enough good things about this place
it ranks up there with the best ever
much appreciated everyone at trailersplus
you really go the extra mile in customer service!
he seemed like a friendly enough sales guy
went here to look for a trailer
took my business else where
you will  get the run around here
we walked in on a tuesday  ready to buy a trailer
i have a 3 or 4 ton truck
of course it can haul a small cargo trailer
it really was as easy as that
these guys are really great
the staff was very polite and helpful
thanks!!!
i had the guys here install my trailer hitch
they did a good job
so  i chose to let a dealer do it
it was fast and simple
i will take my trailer here when it needs service
i was in arizona in may of 2017
i pre made reservations
once we got here in september
they got me back on the road quickly
he did not check back with us
terrible
go anywhere else
i would this place
this camping world was so easy to work with
so painless
a few days later i reached out to them
numerous times
before i finally got my estimate for the repair
they just opened recently so they deserve a break
omg! beware
we found a trailer that we liked
but  we left because the salesman was bad
this time he was willing to work with us
what a joke
our trade in is worth between $28 000
00 to $34 000
they told us they would pay off our trailer
the trailer we wanted was $57 140
the best the could do was $693
00 a month for 180 months
we went through their internet service for our rv
then the problems began
i will never purchase anything from them
we have never had bad service from camping world
i purchased a thor tuscany at 45 on oct 10  2015
do not in anyway believe this nonsense
there is not such thing as elite service
it is not true
or other branches do not consider it a priority
there final cost was over $400
fabulous experience
if you go  see dave and tell him i sent you
do not take your rv there
especially if it  an older model
anyhow  i spoke with the salesperson jeana
one for me and one for my wife
do not ignore all of the negative reviews
they are spot on!  this place blows!
everyone was so nice and helpful
we will  be recommending to everyone we know
purchased a 2005 5th wheel trailer
very poor customer service
i truly believe if i threw a bucket full of 100
they all need to take a customer service class
a fifth wheel that we love  100%
avoid this place if at all possible
bottom line  the communication was awful
never did clean
i had to do it myself
basically backed his staff
very incompetent
had to have the repairs corrected at la mesa rv
listened to my concerns
said he would  take care of me
please heed the reviews
no need to add any more comments
glad i did
not good
the voicemail system is a piece of crap too
he was an absolute prick
the rudest man i have ever met
they do not care a bit about customer service
i will never go back there for anything
hats off to david for working for this jerk
i am calling the owner to complain as well
not even a gee sorry
and we have nothing to show for it
we are still waiting on a call back
i purchased a 22 ft
travel trailer in march of 2016
it took 4 or 5 days to get it cleared up
next my delivery date was set for a saturday
the television did not work either
i told them that was fine
called camping world and they said they had the t
went on vacation up north
the next morning we tried to use the microwave
you guessed it
it did not  work
after vacation took it back in
they ordered all parts again
i waited 3 weeks to get it back
never again will i use them and i have not
also i will never recommend them to anyone
also i did not get my $50
00 in store credit that i was promised
and now i realize the error of my ways
guess what? still no call from them
my first stop there today
camping world is a big kid playground
lessons learned
we went today and was helped by jason
now he was nice
very polite
but man was he cluelesssssss
he told us they had a rpod
speaking of popups i explained we have one now
he points to a hybrid and says yes we have those
i am like noooooo that is not  a popup
explained the difference
this poor kid needs help
clearly training is terrible
nooooooooo
"to that end i would give crossroads an ""f"""
stay away! this place is horrible
some of the worst service i have ever received
you will be sorry
do not deal with camping world!!!!
just be straight with people!
even though it was a weekend
these things always happen on weekends
i think her name was kelly
untill   you signed the deal
in california and arizona
i can assure you they all operate the same way
very unethical practices    low class
want to buy an rvdo not  buy it from them
our experience started out good
the salesman was knowledgable and friendly
unfortunately  our good experience ended there
we bought our brand new camper in may
we took it out that weekend
we were fine with that
we stayed at a site with full hook ups anyway
we went out one more time
no one called
"his response was  ""you and 52 other customers"
their communication is horrible
plus  they are doing nothing to make this right
shame on you  camping world
i will be sure to warn others not to buy here
i would recommend little dealer little prices
what an extraordinarily horrible experience
the parts are still not ordered as of today
there will be follow up postings
they deserve nothing currently
12 or 3 or 14update as promised
received call back last night as promised by gm
also received call this a
from service advisor  darrell
"they are still ""looking into"" the issue"
two more weeks for the correct tent fabric  sigh
keep in mind people
it took a month to get appointment to get it in
and she has been there ever since
love paying on something we do not  get to use
this review is based on their service department
we highly recommend camping world of avondale!
cw did not  budge
you are forewarned
mileage was wrong
we had to go to the dmv to adjust to actual
classic bait and switch
was shown the unit and we liked it
agreed on a purchase price
signed contract and put up earnest money
at this point jim johnston became involved
he is the manager
how was i supposed to know this
the magic word is sorry
seriously?
we received the customer service that we hoped for
thank you kim
#safety-issue  nonworking critical component
i tried the service repair center again
what a joke
i have called 3 days and no call backs
like last time
zero stars and a letter to corporate next
i want to thank the sales staff at camper world
you made us more than whole
outstanding customer service
in need of a camper all i can say
is camper world!!!
thank you so so much josie eric and liz!!
not friendly
sold us wrong products
employees clueless
not a typical camping world
it would be a rating of 0 - but not an option
poor customer service over and over again
when i arrived to pick it up  it was filthy
terrible service department
nobody will call you back
management is a joke
good luck trying to find anyone to help you
my rv coach batterys were not charging
"they said  ""bring it in early"""
i paid my bill of $541
62 and checked at 2:42 pm
i waited about 7 hours
the two coach batterys came to $300
46  labor at $202
reason of review: poor customer service
monetary loss: $100
they sold us a fifth wheel without a title
now refuse to do anything about it
just great
worthless management team
purchased a trailer on 2 or 18 or 17
great customer service
very friendly people
huge selection
tom duluc you are awesome
finally i bought my livinglite 8
4s truck camper and im satisfied with the purchase
smoth transaction
thank you kamper city
jason was our salesperson and he did a great job
i never received a call
such rudeness
such arrogance
i could not  be more satisfied
i heartily recommend doing business here
i have been using rv master techs for over 5 years
and leese who did the detailing also
thank you master techs!
it was plagued with issues for a long time
they had also done warranty work on our fridge
thanks guys :(
he said they were fair and did good work
we had had problems with our awning collapsing
the repair completed  we went on our way south
they are competent and trustworthy
i would  go back any day
thank you eric  jason and crew
they have  earned my business from this day on
corey and the crew are spot on
on time for me and my business is critical
they have handled several projects and repairs
i have never been disappointed
highly recommended
they also service big trucks suspensions
stop in and check this place out!
thanks for helping me out!
best customer service ive had in like forever
he guided me thru a camping trailer build
always answered every dumb question i had
i had a lot
i highly recommend them
immensely impressed with spectrac
i highly recommend him
he is professional all the way
had all the tools to complete the job
i highly recommend him
i ca not  say enough good things about chandler
i called chandler and he fit me in last minute
i cannot recommend him enough
zia did a great job
unfortunately  that had made things worse
thanks chandler!
he has a knowledgeable service and sales staff
have a blessed day
is it ok if we just look
our last fifth wheel was a 38' heartland bighorn
no tricks to their trade  just good honest work
the service is enept
on a 1 to 10 i rate they are 2
i was sold a 28 ft travel trailer
but it was 31 ft
i sure i payed twice
i saw one advertise   at 6800$
i payed 17000
retired and sick
was everthing we wanted and more
like what i saw and people i talked to
brought my trailer in to have service
very disappointing
way over paid for a camper that had so many issues
hind site being 20 or 20
spent our whole vacation fixing issue after issue
honestly the worst camping experience of my life
did not  have any time to spend with my family
go anywhere else for an rv
upon leaving we bought a water hose to fill our rv
this was priced at 29 dollars
i will never be back
you did it!!
mark was also very honest and straightforward
he did not rush us or throw gimmicks our way
the rv is great for the most part
they are a fantastic bunch of professionals
this was a friday afternoon
we did not  see him again until tuesday afternoon
aside from that damage on delivery
the water heater and gas issues continued
really!?!? ok
so i can never see it again? ridiculous
buyers beware
hope this experience helps others!
thanks again
do yourself a favor
skip the others and just go to johnnie walker
they are the best in vegas
we purchased the coach without any hassle
we are sending people here to check them out!
but now i need to add ed
in about 8 more months  i am getting a 5th wheel
do not go anywhere else
this place just ruined our lives
this was supposed to be our home
i dont know what to do
if i were you stay away from johnny walker rv
just disgusting
we are in the market for a travel trailer
mark was so knowledgeable and helpful
great experience!
it was well taken care of by the original owner
i told denny i would be back
denny worked hard to make it happen
my heart fell like t ton of bricks
00 less a month
then we spent the night
amazing owners or staff
the park is clean and quiet
i highly recommend this rv park
the park is very easy to maneuver
we have a 40' class a and had no problem parking
we had to walk with our 3 young children
all of this was rediculous  the place was gross
but our grandchildren love this place!!
full hookups
great fun during race time
the proprietor here is a very bad person
do not pay him
full hookups
great fun during race time
the staff is super and very helpful
site are well groomed
i moved and my insurance went down $56
i absolutely love living in these apartments
i love living in 9920 apartments
maintenance is prompt and reliable
deea and lisa are the best management
they take care of us and our very accommodating
never have to wait long at all
no one could ever fill their shoes
i found some really great prices for cable
we want to stay here forever!!!!
i moved in january 2014
the layouts are spacious and clean
the location is perfect
& now it  legal
the irony
this place has gone completely down the tubes
it is 100% ghetto now
yes   this is the new apartment version
we even have water bugs now
ca not  wait to move
this is by far the worst place ever
the crowd is very friendly and pleasant
the place is well lit and i feel very safe here
stop!! do not rent here
be prepared to get ran over
cars speeding all hours of the night
go green save the planet type of environment
they will harass you and kick you out
price is way way to expensive for what you get
the absolute worst experience i have  ever had
i suggest shopping around
literally!!
"used these guys to ""repair"" 2 motor mounts"
go figure the mounts were both broken
we have been going there for years
the grounds and facility are top notch
there is professional security 24 or 7
we will definitely keep going there when in vegas
the park is large and has a nice pool area
i called management and the manager did not care
i guess i am  the odd ball
we have stayed in two different levels of sites
i would definitely return to the oasis
we like the park and the staff is very nice
we would definitely stay here again
all of the staff was friendly as well
looking forward to our next visit
fancy dancy
that place was feeling like a real rv resort
checking in was a breeze
friendly service and staff
we paid $55
00 a night
nice big spots
cement pad
clean and neat
i did not  smell any dog urine while i was there
there  a restaurant on site along with a gift shop
laundry room was small but clean and only $1
50 for using the washing machines and $1
00 for dryers
easy acess to interstate
i would definitely stay here again
this is absolutely a resort
in the rv world that word
is misused a lot
the oasis rv resort is awesome
great amenities
fabulous property   great location  great staff
we were very happy here
thank you for a great time in las vegas!
nice place
very helpful guest services
instead of parked rv
very nice & clean rv park near everything
outlet mall and strip
excellent jacuzzi with strong jets
snack bar & restaurant
nice work-out room with good equipment
a true resort would have had more amenities
we will define be returning again
it was quiet and well maintained
very nice rv resort
no tent camping
our site has grass and is a pull thru
pet  are allowed
they do have a no pet section
three dog  are the maximum  county ordnance
we had nearby smokers and wow was intolerable
very professional staff
good security
superb bathrooms
cemented and flat pods
environmental noise almost unbearable
easy access to local casinos and stores
nice but no privacy between rigs in premium plus
sooo big  soooo many people
not very many at the pool in november
laundry room busy
the park is huge here
we did and there was an opening
hallelujah!!!  thank you oasis rv park
i flew in early before the rest of my party
awesome first day
absolutely loved our time here
they even have a cafe for your convenience
we will definitely be back
i  recommend this resort to anybody in this area
very clean and well maintained location
i would highly recommend this place
love  love  love this resort
the staff and guests are awesome
clean  with great amenities
thanks oasis  see you in may
i came here after selling my home
go to rv parks on boulder highway
one and done oasis
but  we only stayed one night
the bathrooms are clean and well kept
however  the shower head was pretty gross
they need to be dipped in clr and disinfectant
lobby - does not open until 7am
staff - very friendly and accommodating
security - i felt very safe in this park
we will stay here again
my family
enjoyed our stay here
we will be back
look forward to seeing him again
beats anything on the strip for sure
i really thought this was a great park
the staff here was fantastic
the pool area was very nice
there is a kids pool and adult pool area
it  not like we were at the beach
seems like a safety issue to me
we will stay here again
there are no fire rings
clean  quiet and easy to access sights
super pet friendly & the kiddo  loved the pool  !
it  an ok place to stay
the front desk and store staff
less than stellar
there are a lot of rules
and i mean a lot
so if you have pets or kids just be cautious
it  quiet and the restrooms have single showers
it  really quite a nice place
the problem is they have terrible wi-fi
it  definitely their service provider lv
i am  not asking to stream movies
i just want to get my email and surf the web
it  virtually impossible
i ca not  do my simple work tasks here
it took me 2 hours just to read my e-mail
***wifi is now free***1
it  fairly secure  clean  etc
we had an issue
a great rv resort for families and retired folk
very quiet and lots of grass
shuttle to the strip
first time staying here and fell in love with it
very clean and well maintained
i highly recommend it!
pools are nice  small cafe with acceptable food
small store
pet areas are just gravel with chain link fence
one laundry room for the whole park
this water is tepid at best
one must ponder how these showers get disinfected
we had two bikes stolen
charging $1
seems not right
nice entry  nice office and pool area
an extra $20 per month to have mail forwarded
little privacy or room
very nice resort but busy
a lot of people stay here
they should remove it
streets are tight too for that big of a rig
spent 5 days here
we did not  get a chance to really use the resort
i ca not  say enough about this place
we stayed four nights
place was pretty quiet  except for airplanes
we were in spot 126  a pull through site
pushy time share sales person in the clubhouse
glad i found it  this place is very nice
i stayed 3 nights
seemed to be a very decent crowd here
oasis has gone downhill in the past two years
smells like dog pee everywhere
very happy staying here  it is worth the money
but here i am
this place was the 5 star hotel of rv parks
when it says oasis  it means it
i will be back!
this park is one of the best we have ever been to
the store has everything you need
only open for breakfast and lunch though
pool is very nice
easy access to this park from any direction
we have stayed here twice
spotless
tight security
super pool area and clubhouse
100% on all counts
decent wifi too
we have stayed at this resort over a dozen times
hands down the nicest place we have ever stayed
this is a huge rv park with over 700 sites
we stayed 4 nights and the park was sold out
the whole family agreed that 5 stars is fair
lots of nice conveniences
the dog runs are great
nice rv park
needs some updates
more space around the sink
no place to put your stuff
laundry rooms need a really good cleaning
the dryer vents really need vacuumed
pool is nice
i like the separate adult & kids areas
dog parks need a good cleaning
they stink like urine
need more gravel & power wash the fence
horseshoe pits waste of space
no one ever uses them
and maybe bbq grills
wifi is ok
spotty if you have trees in the area
cable needs updated with more channels
staff is so so
it  a resort
it  a destination
no quarters until later
come back in a bit
the couple that host it are on a cruise
hope the pancake guy does not  go on a cruise
really not a family safe place
ca not  really promise i will  be back
good morning!! welcome to las vegas!!!
this is a discriminatory and outdated policy
we ended up staying one night and then leaving
we will never be back to your facility
fox car rental is 1
i love this place!
made reservation by phone
told them we had dogs
so we could not stay
great place to stay and great price
the pool was fantastic on a hot day
easy to get to from the highway
easy to maneuver our 40 ft 5th wheel
this is a typical rv park
and the police could not  find her in the park
the pools are nice and so is the hot tub
it  expensive
nothing to write home about
front bumper and rear bumper were at the curbs
did not  try netflix streaming
loved our stay very much
we enjoyed our time at the oasis
the park was clean and i felt safe
the staff was very courteous
staff is helpful and friendly
place is always immaculate
landscaping is extremely tidy and pleasant
probably more that i do not  even know about
we are  done and wo not  be back
32' class a
the resort itself is excellently maintained
spaces are large  even the back-ins
nice dog run area
this was our 2nd time ever using our airstream
the staff were all very nice
it  very clean
even the shower rooms were clean and roomy
we did not  always have hot water though
guess what oasis  your the loser
wi-fi never worked
no concierge service
love this rv park
super friendly staff
the gentlemen at the gate are always smiling
clean park
super clean showers
very quiet
nice size rv spots
never will stay in a hotel in las vegas again
this place seems to have plenty of space
very easy access  clean  safe
has a nice pool with a sandy beach surrounding it
it was very quiet at night
i did not  even realize anyone was around us
we loved the little restaurant
it was very good and very inexpensive
club house is huge  with good food
everything is very clean
very well kept place for the size
kids had a blast in the pool
if i had kids i definitely would not stay here
price is very responsible and for fare
so many things to do here
love  love  love it here
do not rent from here
we rented a lamborghini for my dad  60th birthday
they ruined the whole day
there are lots of other options in toronto
do not  go here
do not rent from these guys!
make sure you specify which vehicle you want
never rent rv with bates
wish them the best of luck!
tim also made a few recommendations
his pricing is not  bad at all to
i needed brakes for my 1999 ford ranger pick up
in terms i could understand
later that day i returned to pick up my vehicle
what a terrific job tim did
my pick up is just great
so glad to have the brakes working well
he is great
this is the first yelp review i have  written
tim did a great job  he was very informative
i will be going back for sure
would recommend getting your next one done here
perhaps it is because i am a woman
started work at 11 am and finished at 11:37
i will take it elsewhere
everything around you is only 1 - 5 hour drive
we saw that palm gardens got good reviews
he went ballistic
honestly you can stay busy every night
you can own a home here  or you can rent
he was on time  fast  friendly
wish more auto businesses were run like this!!!
office staff is friendly and helpful
sites are tidy and the guests are friendly
i stayed in a 30' tt and was fine
full hookups  cable tv  solid pads for parking
we will  be back for sure
this is an awesome rv park
well lit  gated  and friendly well trained staff
it  noice place
traffic 10mph it  a joke
people go flying tru here more like 25mph
we should not have had to pay over 60
we only stayed a couple nights long enough
i stayed here for business
this was not  the worst part
we have been coming to this park for 12 years
very disappointed for the last two years
this year was the topper
would never come back to this park again
gm wo not  even return calls!
i also bought a spare rim and tire
rucker trailer works is a professional shop
i had half a trailer i put together
they took what i started  put wheels under it
i would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone
i would  use them again
these guys do great work!
neil and crew are fantastic
they have done a bit of work on our popup
honest guys
very reasonable prices
kurthighline automotive
if you want to buy an rv  motor home etc
this is the place
great selection
people come from all over just to buy from here
i highly recommend this dealership
tom shoemaker is the sales manager
thank you for your kindness and hospitality
water popcorn
we emailed our salesman to no response
not happy
two tips if you plan on using this dealership
the sale part was pleasant
go see avery
no pressure
very helpful
did not  hover
did not  bug us
i will definitely buy my rv from him
just ca not  decide which one
so   we are going back
stay away!
they claimed oil had been changed
it had not
it was not3
the lp propane connector was not  connected
how could this pass testing?4
interior carpeting had been delivered uncleaned
how unsanitary5
delivered with yellow check engine light on
wow  really?6
a or c needed repairing
they claimed it just needed freon
then why did not  they put some in?
shady sales people and owners does not  care
run away from robert crist dealership
that  just wrong!
garry o did a great job with me
he listened and understood exactly what i wanted
awesome experience!!!
we would highly recommend this company
worst customer service ever
terrible place
that  where customer service ends
they do not back what they sell
buyer beware
we really appreciate this place- thank you!
the trailer has been amazing
they did it quickly and very inexpensively too
i asked about replacing the tire
they gave me a quote  which was a little high
guess what? he zipped over to amazon
com  found the part in less than 30 seconds
he asked me for my email  and sent me the link
95 shipped prime
f*cking incredible
the whole phone call took like 90 seconds
bravo  christian
keep it up trailers plus!
my wife was in hospital when axle came in
worst customer service ever
i wish i had found this place sooner
extremely friendly and helpful
competitively priced
he took me to k&c auto  only a few blocks away
i explained further
i was floored
we would  all be better off
thank you
for being you
i learned about this shop through a family friend
we are  really busy today
they are a group of honest and trustworthy guys
they are fair priced and kind as well
my last instance was an exhaust leak
mazda wanted 750$ for the part that i needed
what an awesome place
everyone was so friendly and welcoming
great resort  jan at the desk was super helpful
great dog areas
lots to do
we have booked for next year
this place rocks
seriously
the entrance is typical and unassuming  but tiddy
we love vvv
i am on the bowling league and had a blast
we are definitely coming back!!
they are an honest reputable business
we will definitely be back
wifi  washer and dryer you can use
50 amp service  dump station
had our rv repaired
took less time than stated
yeah!  back on the road again
great price
clean coach when picked up
easy to get to
owner and mechanics were great
24hr on site security
large clean buildings to work in
in & out fast
it was too late
no honesty and a surprise
so disappointing
still do not  have title work after six months
rudest most unhelpful staff every
trent and brian took great care of us overall
absolutely the very worst repair experience ever
this place is at best spastic
i will  never go back once i retrieve my rv
to bad there is not a negative star scale
it would be a negative 10
oh no once you buy it your screwed
we have had nothing but broken promises
we told them we had a trip in 3 weeks
no problem we will put a rush on it
yea right we have  heard that before
i do not  know how they stay in business
do not  waste your time!!!  do not  go here!!!
guess what  no more coffee
take one minute and you will  figure it out
adios camping world
horrible experience
i would stay away from this place
i will not be removing my review
went in to look at buying a tt
we sold it for full list price  $8900
no customer service
he never bothered to call me back
i know because it happened to me
picked up my rv from them on friday
really unimpressed
avoid this place if you can!
this review is for the service dept
i t is 11:30am and we are still waiting
just another lie
do not waste your time
their sales team sucks and so does their service
avoid at all costs  terrible service
we have yet to receive the coach back completed
i will never buy another camper from them again
do not  come here
run away
just got home form camping world! wow what a joke
$33 after the $20 coupon for merchandise
now comes the fun part
we returned them for a refund
after about 10 min
they told me that there system could not do that
finally got the $33 back for the sheets
why would any body do business with this company
never again!
worst customer service on the planet
go anywhere else and you will be happier
after 5 minutes of waiting i hung up
ca not  wait to see him in person
we then came across a used 2006 toy hauler
camping world sucks
stay away!
be careful
well  i guess i got lucky today
keith at mesa cw  really saved my bacon
we get back and bring it in immediately
this was the first step to a fantastic vacation
if possible i would stay far away from this place
-10 star!!!
i wish i could give the service dept
no stars! awful service department
here is what happened
this is the place
very shoddy for a $34 000
00 trailer
i was trading up from a class c to a class a
had a deal $15k difference
we all agreed
signed the paperwork
walked out
do not buy here
always have problems with the service dept
i decided i wanted a forest river  mercedes 24'
cold showers
so getting on to our trip the next day
sales person sergio   was rude as well
that  ridiculous and  horrible customer service
thanks again!!!
66 for the repair
66 and got no response
absolutely wonderful
the internal side is horrible
i have usaa
"i said ""oh well if it is not """
almost too pushy
thanks camping world
"i will  call you back"""
no phone call back
this is not  their first rodeo
all i can say is az is the rv capital of the us
shop around
others would love to have your business
take a look at your reviews
if i could give less stars  i would
run  dont walk to any other rv service center
finally  after 6 weeks i had to use the rv
i show up and surprise surprise it  not ready
so here i sit waiting and writing the review
this place is horrific!
talking about buying an rv only
they are ripoff artists
even a place like little dealer does not do that
stay away and spend your money elsewhere
was looking for a carry bag for a rv rug
found it on their site
drove 30 min to the store
no apologies that i drove out
so first now i will  pay 8
95 shipping on am 11
bad business and your loosing sales
worst customer service ever
5 hours at a rate of $125 per hour
5 to 4 hour labor
i was able to settle on a price for over $700
if there was a negative star
i would have given it to them
all this hassle for being a loyal member
never  never  never buy from campers world
friday comes and goes and we hear no word
"will she be back tomorrow?  ""i do not  know"
but i will  send her an email
sometimes she looks at those from home
very professional young man
and  the service manager never did talk to us
way too little  way too late
i hope this review helps!
both daryl and alberto went above and beyond
this is how your customers will come back
well done guys
mileage was wrong
we had to go to the dmv to adjust to actual
had to bring it back
sadly that happens often
again  i fault the system  not the people
tom:  keep working on your customer service issues
you have your work cut out for you
keep trying
he was very helpful and wonderful to work with
we picked up our rv yesterday
scary to think thats what his concern was
i am also open to suggestions
two weeks later i call them
no one can even see a case opened for me
if i could give this place a no stars  i would
the shopping or store is nice as well
i hope not
first yelp review ever
ca not  believe it had to be so bad
4 months later we got our camper back
this is to all avondale camping world customers
thank you
i would not refer anyone to buy an rv from here
the sales department is awful
the delivery process is horrible
they barely told us how to use the brand new rv
uneducated  no answers  clueless
we wish we would have!
the buying process and sales guy was great
and no return anything
i called and even went in to find out something
okay great
first and last that is
today i picked up my rv
go anywhere else to get your rv worked on
made me feel at home and is a hell of a guy
so we had to leave the camper again
i do not  know what to do
this story is to be continued
and definitely not an rv
it has almost a year
hint  recreation means fun
we can afford to buy an rv  and 2
definitely not going here again
i cringe every day i go in there for anything
naturally no one was there to help me
now how hard was that
do yourselves a  favor stay away from this place!
communication was fairly non-existent
if not stay completely away
this dealership is a joke!!
or anyone else for that matter
we even have the 1 year free of good sam
but that is also through camping world
it was not  ready
it was not
campingworld service department was a joke
we will not be taking our rv there again
better go somewhere else  if you want work done
this place deserves no stars at all
now let me tell you why
what we liked: our salesperson
this was our first rv
i bet i know why
it was nearly new
we were told they would check it top to bottom
when we got there the generator was not working
do not  understand why it was not  fixed
back it went to the shop
a 3-hour pick up turned out to be a 5
5-hour trip
3) two days after we had our rv the financial dept
in two minutes he found the problem
i am  pretty sure the rest  just do not  care
so mismanaged
deleting avondale  information from my phone
hope to never go there again
read the other reviews
i wish i had
i lost the desire to do any shopping there
not a good sign
i expected a complete walk through
not worth nearly 700
on a post-it that we were shown
not given
then he got a return call
to date  usaa has not received the check
we received the check yesterday  june 1st
stay away!!!!betty flocken
i  unfortunately  did not  get her name
this place is horrible
i really felt sorry for him
we bought a brand new unit at avondale
we did not  get either
he was rude and insulting
we also had problems getting the title
the unit was back at camping world several times
it  not worth dealing with this location
this place is absolutely horrible
my hat is off to don & corey thank you so much
i am a first time rv buyer
word of advice
stay away
this is september!!!
go to camping world and see larry
all the employees were very helpful
i bought a 2017 retro 176s
i had an awning replaced on my pop-up camper
they were very nice
hilarious installation mistakes ensued
we just purchased our 2nd camper
staff are always very nice and eager to help
i was extremely pleased
kamper city saved our vacation
i made two calls for help
several things were wrong from the beginning
it  a mess
i will have to work with them for a resolution
we will  definitely be back!
i was greeted by a rude salesperson
nope  not at kamper city
his original sticker price
even though i know they were backed up
thank you for taking care of my 5th wheel
they did a great job with the fix
nothing seems to stump them
quality repair facility
i had a scheduled appointment about 10 days out
made with jason
had a bent frame  bent basement locker
i highly recommend this shop
kona  hawaii
now let  talk pricing
the internet special was $299 for a wash and wax
no buffing out up there
you have got to be kidding
these guys are truly awesome
enough said
best customer service ive had in like forever
he guided me thru a camping trailer build
always answerd every dumb question i had
i had a lot
i highly recommend them
staff friendly and knowledgeable
thanks chandler!
the best at what he does in town
thanks zia i wish all companies were like you!!!!
many high end coaches inside an ac building
the panels were covered  with bird poop
the staff are friendly and helpful
the residents are lovely
i would not call it a resort
we had no problem parking our 45 ft rv
nice office staff
had planned to be there 2 days  and stayed 4 days
we will stop again if we pass by on the way home
great rv park for big rigs
we are 67 feet including our trailer
could not  get tv but that was fine
very friendly staff
enjoyed our stay!
i did not stay at this park
it looks nice  the customer service is good
very friendly
we recently stayed at this rv park for 4 days
the hook ups and space were all good
it is a quiet rv park that had a good feel to it
we brought our german shepherd with us
this is the best resort i have ever been to
great activities and great activity director
this is a great rv park
there is a nice indoor pool and hot tub
everyone was friendly  including the other guests
obviously they do not  want business
we attempted to book for our campervan
resort is a real stretch
nice pool & spa
showers are not handicapped accessible
nice library  free ice machine
concert patio pads are small & some are cracked
palm trees are in the way and offer no shade
no wifi & no cable
they are also very close together
we feel very safe and comfortable here
rates are reasonable for the area
shopping is close if you need anything
we stayed at this rv park for two nights
we tried to reserve an rv space for january
they are well rated by good sam  also
we love desert shadows rv resort
the staff are friendly
the indoor pool is clean
the jacuzzi pool is large and clean  too
this park is rv & has many park models
this is our third stay here
we are  15 minutes from anthem
also easy to get to - 1 or 2 mile off i- 17
beware the guys in the golf carts that work here
this is a glorified trailer park
not an rv resort
the sites are what brings the rating down
this is more a park model resort than an rv park
they are also very close together
same for wifi
the amenities are another thing altogether
washers cost $1
25  dryers are $0
50 for 20 minutes
there  a large  heated indoor pool and hot tub
i will probably not go again
more than a campground
a great day adventure by lake mead
a serene lake mead is the star of the campground
i was on the path to dehydration
ten miles of beautiful scenery
this review is for the beach area only
the beach is clean and the water is clear
we even saw fish! my 2
overall  this is a nice beach to come to
no privacy at all
people camping within arms length
kind of a dump
which was obvious shady
bring your own shade and for the beach area
boulder beach is what i will refer to in this post
all are well maintained and so is the shoreline
will defiantly do again!!!
had a great experience at this campground
super clean and well kept campground
nice fire pits and tables
no animals or bugs when we were there
there is not  much to do
thanks boulder for your hospitality!
it was pretty quite  so that was nice!
generally a nice quiet campground
the hosts are super nice
park rangers patrol frequently
the ranger came to talk to them  to no avail
the people we spoke to were fantastic
it was very confusing
really wish there were showers here!
get there early to beat the crowd
bring water shoes
this is a review for the beach only
there is ample parking in a rock parking lot
so i have  got to be honest  i am  not a camper
we booked a group site
i appreciated the flush toilet and working sinks
nice amount of space  grill  and fire pit
four picnic benches
overall  nice campground in great location
spaces were spacious
only thing missing was a place to shower
from my experience it is a rocky magaritaville
the west portion is three separate shady areas
this is one of my favorite picnic areas in nevada
to me  it is magaritaville in the desert
the daniel
s 2013 yelp 100 challenge
review 93
wonderful place!!
toilets are clean! 20$ a night  perfectly fine!
avoid the snake holes
playing my b
king extra loud
now to hide it from everyone
oh that will do nicely
lots of trees and flowering bushes
we will definitely go here again and again
this place is sadly in really poor conditions
camp is in horrible conditions
camp workers are rude and condescending
been here many times and it  very noisy
good luck
you know  if i lived in my tent full-time
the beach itself is kind of gross
i really wanted to love it but
i would  probably shower in chlorine afterwards
if you can get internet to work
my lte barely worked
very nice park
beautiful landscaping and view of mead lake
you can walk to downtown
amenities are top notch
great place and would definitely stay there again
dealing with brent and spencer was fantastic
5 minutes from lake mead
also enjoy the heated pool and spa year round
also enjoy the heated pool and spa year round
this is a lovely resort
very clean  quiet friendly place
excellent customer service
well kept and clean park with lots of amenities
we really enjoyed our stay
great vacation spot!!
great customer service
this was my first time at this repair shop
i did not  get that sense with this place
good experience
i understand this because i teach it
thanks guys!
so i paid $119
99 plus tax $136
31 out the door
which i did
so  i bring it back to brake masters
now cylinder 6 ignition coil was found to be bad
on july 20  2016   i paid  $231
54 to have cylinder 6 ignition coil replaced
yay! then i headed over to brake masters
i will update this post soon
the customer service here is awful
rude and unprofessional
"11"" or whatever inflated sum you are  charging"
rude beyond measure
he saved my a**
update on the 8 or 25 or 16 post
david was very nice and informative
and they had free wi-fi for their guests
visiting this location was a breath of fresh air
i was treated so well
people like him are hard to find
trust me when i tell you this is the place to go
mike and dave are incredibly polite and helpful
they truly care about their customers
i will be back for all my car needs
they said to bring it by as soon as i could
highly recommend this place
doyle is hands down just a great person
i left there with tears of joy
i will continue to go to doyle
come here if you want a great experience
i would  give a million stars if i could
great company with great people
we appreciated their honesty so much
these guys really know their stuff
we will be recommending them to our friends
thanks brake masters!
they stripped the threads on my new oil pan
they were the first ones to touch it
no one else could have done it
which was not  the case it was new
it has been two years since my review
i want to add a couple of comments
first  if i could give six stars i would
~ first  they took my car in immediately
~ wifi is available if you have to wait
~ the staff is friendly and informative
and they actually explain things to you
and then -- there  jake
i know a lot of people his age
he is one special guy
he then proceeded to come up with a solution
i was on my way
it was a great experience
00!beware of this place!
this place is great
i will be back!
mike and dave are wonderful
this shop is amazing
excellent customer service
i cannot say enough great things about this place
i took my car in and was greeted by dave
he took care of me right away
great service! dave and mike are both great
my car was done quickly and is running perfectly
love this place!!! will definitely be going back
highly recommend
the customer service here is perfect
they got it fixed asap
also priced very fair
always recommend this place
dave is very friendly  knowledgeable  and honest
turned out i did not  need them
great job guys!
i thought - wow! she  getting the vip treatment
she must know some one
nope! that  just how they are
i am surprised by some of the reviews posted here
i would recommend steve at davenport
mike riggs general manager progressive hardscapes
he has a dirty  cluttered  one stall shop
i had another shop fix his mess
when presented with the bill he refused to pay it
i would never recommend this shop to anyone
i would not take my rig to these people
a very very non respectable way to run a business
"if needed they will make ""house calls 'also"
you will not regret using them
cannot recommend this place enough
excellent trustworthy business
thanks chuck your the best
we took it in to have them look at it
dangerous and ignorant mistake
will not be coming back
i have complete confidence with this shop
super knowledgeable and were quick and friendly
trustworthy
dependable
the folks at dean  are great--honest and helpful
you wo not  be disappointed
these guys are my new best friend
and i thank bobby for the referral
dean  auto is getting my business
we were quoted about a week turnaround
thanks joe  joseph  and the rest of the team!
i had two areas i was told needed repair
i am so happy i did
the second and most expensive  was not a problem
thank you so much for honest and good service
all around great family feel place
they were friendly and inviting
he understood
i believe they are crooks
never will i go to deans auto joke
friday  august 18th
i dropped off the car at 11am
i went immediately to the shop
no apologies were made to me
confused  i replied that i did not want it
that was just the first call
again  great customer service
they continue to impress me
spend just over $400 to get a coolant leak fixed
i had coolant everywhere
i refused to let them touch my car
i have yet to receive a phone call
i am a cynic and can find fault in everything
the transmission was completely shot
they are knowledgeable and straight shooters
what they know about rvs is just amazing
they cleared them out and got things working
put in the water 5-3 2015
boat would not go over 5mph
it happened about 10 ft up the ramp
boat was returned on monday
great family business
terrible customer service
boat is in a marina
have been waiting over a month
new shop will pick up boat in 2 days
do not  waste you time with this shop!
they had the repair fixed in a timely manner
sincerely ray m
from ravenna
both of my air conditioners were not working
they have worked well since then
i purchased a toy hauler from them
i wo not  go back
the older rv was very well maintained
i had laura and will  cell numbers 'just in case'
i highly recommend this local company
to sahara rv
there was no mix up
you had the pump in stock
the going rate
i urge other rvers to shop elsewhere!
i live in so
he is super
what a nice guy
then at drop off  we see will  again
that is great customer service
thanks laura and will!!
i rented a pop-up trailer from sahara rv center
the workmanship was so sloppy
what a huge mistake
hopefully  this is not  a common result
better to not make the same mistake i did
we rented an rv for an 11 day vacation in utah
the rv was comfortable and up to the task
we especially appreciated laura and will
that was annoying but not a huge issue
fast friendly and easy going
and they are us the lowest in price
place is horrible
very unorganized place
staff: the staff is very nice
when we picked it up  we were satisfied
thank you!
laura ended up giving us a break at close out
i would definitely rent from this company again
they give you free mileage but trust me
it ends up not being worth it
take pictures of inside out and the top
great service
thanks junior!
i got an rv that was a complete disaster
they gave me a $50 credit
stay away would be my recommendation
last month i had to rent an rv for work reasons
5 stars sahara rv!
thanks so much for making my trip easy!
units are very well taken care of and run nicely
staff is extremely friendly and always helpful
highly recommend!!! 10 or 10
our upgraded rv was old and tattered
only one side had seat belts
i understand why
cost us 1200 00 and they will not reimburse us
they were not qualified to do the work
we are in the process of suing them
found what we wanted  smooth from start to finish
delivered as promised
everyone was up front and honest
look at nadaguides
com before you buy
good luck and safe travels
thanks for getting our rv on the road so quit !!
we did not get a response
do not leave your rv on consignment here!!!!!!!
one star because there is no zero option
needed a water pump
website says $108
99 so i confirm they have it in stock
i think not
last year i turned my motorhome in for repairs
i should have taken it to small claims
do not  trust them check everything out yourself
this is the absolute worst rv rental place ever
old high mile and dirty rv
we were in need of help
we picked up our rv
they said issue was fixed
we paid and back @ camp issue came back
well we now know why
we had not  even owned the thing a week
problem after problem after problem
what a shady business!! and all this on a 2007
do not go here
stay far away
i bought a ac unit from sahara rv
put it on our travel trailer
worked for 2 days and stopped working
mind you i just purchased last week
all of the costs were well-explained up front
in fact he made my problem worse
between texting and calling  no response
beware!!!
we called em up and they said bring it in
30 minutes later jared met us out front
he began immediately working on the furnace
jared and his team are not just part installers
he also recommended a place to stay and eat
thanks again for your help
you guys rock!
going to pu trailer tomorrow
a horrific experience
just broken promises
wow  that was a stroke of luck
i will  be going here for all my rv repair needs!
no nonsense and very capable
use this company you wo not  be disappointed
and i am very frustrated
still great
next the hot water heater
! i would highly recommend him!
they went above and beyond
thanks guys  it really meant a lot!
i stand by my review
not sure how to feel about this company
we used their mobile services
excellent in every way
they gave me a fair estimate
i highly recommend them
was very appreciative of both of their help
tried to find someone to fix our gas line
jar of told us to get to him asap
we pulled up  saw about 30 rvs
never imagined we would be out of there in one day
highly recommend
thank you drew so much
straight up and honest
excellent company   i highly recommend them
owner was hostile
took no responsibility
terrible customer service
i would not recommend this company
7 days later still no word
these guys are awesome
great customer service! highly recommended!
we know jared and his family for years
i also wanted to add a 3rd ac unit
when i got to la mesa rv
5 hours in total and saved our weekend
tops in my view!
sent email on sat and left phone msg on sun
best mobile service ever
thanks  jared
the tiffin motorhome co
excellent quality service
excellent
thanks for the great service
as it turned out  it was defective
ca not  say enough good things!
they exceeded my expectation
very professional outfit
i would  highly highly recommended!
i had jti install a trailer hitch on my crv today
the work was done promptly and professionally
i would  recommend this place to anyone
way to go jti!
do not come here
their customer service is abysmal
the sales team is very helpful and friendly
it disappeared on my way to camping
are you kidding me? it was an awful experience
everything about this experience was excellent
we are very happy with our purchase
save yourself some stress and go somewhere else
sure  they are  nice enough and do a good job
you could have  at least wiped it off
friendly and a fun place to hang out
love our local elks lodge
this is another really nice rv park
we like staying here
we did that this time
however  like i said
the rv park here is really great
we are  glad they have the park for us to use
another great elks rv campground
they have 15 nice size sites with full hook ups
lots of things to see and do in boulder city
always great food
you will love it!
for rversgood: very quiet at night
owner said she did not care how they parked
not a sandy bottom swim areas as advertised
staff turns off water based slides etc
what a joke
they never answer the phone
the staff is cocky and rude
never happened
also the showers are gross
what a shame
great property terrible staff
"not even an ""i am  sorry"" about the iphone"
not sure what to say about this place
the place was quiet and almost deserted
it was pretty disgusting
will never go back
i checked in here traveling across the us
darlene otis was gen mg
my mother in law is a senior citizen
she fell sick
we had to leave a day early
we asked for a days credit
thank you
we had a nice experience here
we will go back!
i have to admit  i was asking for a lot
i called the day before labor day weekend
the park is well kept and has great facilities
do not stay here! water is a major problem
it backs up into your rv
electricity goes out for hours at a time
there was plenty of room for my 100 guests
"they were very ""hands off"" which i appreciated"
thanks for the great service and follow up
i am very happy to have stumbled across them
"az rv service will be our ""rv guys"" from now on"
thanks for a job well done!
here is my experience with arizona rv service
was told they would look into it and call back
i have not  heard squat
this seems to be a theme in mesa
ridiculous!
i also got a few supplies while i was there
absolutely great
thank you so much
just wow
over the weekend  the refrigerator failed
i mean  repair place
these guys are great
they fixed our ac ceiling unit and dash ac
they were friendly worked with our insurance
wow! these guys were great
andy is very talented and personable
they were very friendly
i owe these folks an updated review
i have  consistently get the run around
i think we found our rv service center for life
very impressed and excited to meet dave and mike
the air conditioner went out on my rv
i should have just left at this point
therefore time was very important to us
so here is where the rip off part comes in
00 of work
they wanted $1750
00 for the part and 3 hours of labor
the next day they gave me an appointment
we replace them all the time
00 for the seal and $400 to replace it
00 less than arizona rv llc
and they charged me $55
do not  go here
we also saw various technicians during our visit
arizona rv services saved us
we dropped in on them
they were very busy
dave held a class for us  awning 101
will not take my rv here again
promise dates were never kept
we rented from the whitehorse office
staff were excellent - very helpful and friendly
all of their vehicles appeared to be immaculate
we rented a ford f350 with a camper
it was well suited to a couple and teenager
the company stored our suitcases which was great
overall  this was a great experience
great service and friendly staff
great overall experience
we had the midi b as a family of 4
far to many hidden fees
i would not  recommend them to anyone
definitely select a different rental company
stayed last year
just did it and were disappointed
no fireplace
the toilet ran and the sink dripped
also they put wood floors everywhere
not so clean and cold take slippers
camped here over the weekend
all sites are set way back off the lake
very little access for shore fishing
poison ivy all around tight or small campground
grounds or maintenance crew should spray this
its worth checking it out
i was disappointed with the beach
there was none of that  but the water was gross
natural  but gross and unfit for swimming
it covered everything
i sunbathed for a couple hours and left
we did not  get to hike
the beach just was not  one of them
always a nice park
i went to see the birds
great place to park and eat a bagged lunch
lots of walkers with dogs
nice place to drive through
but that  about it
the beach is horrific honestly
disgusting
very relaxing location
the cabin was clean and well maintained
they had plastic chairs
my family of 6 camped at site 199
we had 2 adults and 4 kids aged 4-7
00 visitor fee
we also got bad cases of chiggers after we left
overall it really was a great campground
all was very nice
we were there for 2 nights  july 10 & 11
it gets busy during the typical weekends
memorial day  july 4th  etc
typically during the week
i have only visited in the winter
for me  punderson= sledding
""" you know  before america turned fat"
it  not exercise if its fun
"then it  called ""play"""
come and play at pundersons
they have snowmobiling  sledding  skiing
all kinds of things to do
see for yourself
the manor house is beautiful and well kept
the dinner room is very nice and the menu good
the rooms are large and well appointed
i would not recommend them to anyone
if you ask around   response and experience
here  the details
that was nice to see
no complaints
he was trying to get one  but was not  able to
ok  minor complaint
they tested it and called me to come get the rv
price was fair for the work done
at that point  i was happy with their work
it was the same code as before
i asked that they look into it
they said they would look at it and let me know
they never looked at my rv
after two weeks  i gave up and picked up my rv
which was not  what i had returned the rv for
they highly recommended two companies
i left the unit and a few weeks past
i paid for the work done to date and left
i paid the bill and left
it is not an invoice or billing statement
this was not the case with gene  rv
they were able to come to our site within 48 hours
gene was prompt  friendly and knowledgeable
the charges were reasonable
highly recommend this company
family owned business
excellent job at a reasonable price
the also except extended service insurance
i explained i had no way to take it there
i also never got an apology for their error
gene  rv & ac repair replaced my home ac unit
ok  destinee  blah  blah  blah
i do not recommend this company
do  not use this company for a fun rv weekend
stay away
"you are taking the vehicle in ""as is condition"""
the guy who answered the phone was rude
the problem
find another place to rent from
no pun intended but i am one happy camper
once again  thank you robert
the early pickup was ol
about 1 hours with introduction
the rv was ok and we had no problems with it
the service is bad
we waited 1 hour in line to return our vehicle
next time we will rent at roadbearrv
dropping off the rv however was easy
let me start that customer service sucks
returning it has been just as bad
in retrospect  a bad sign
similarly  returning the rv took 1
pretty unsafe
"my kids named it ""the hunk of junk"
""" these rvs have been ridden hard"
well  i am really disappointed in this company
they nickel and dime for everything
just keeps getting better
not going to work
last time renting here
the customer service is very inconsistent
the check-in process i experienced was abysmal
- allow 2 hours for rental
- do not  pay for the bedding and kitchen utensils
we checked in at 2 pm but after 1
fitz crew
check-in went smoothly and relatively quickly
the rv was in very good condition ane clean
ok whateversss
ok the tire gets fixed on our way home again
i told the lady we were pulling almost $100 000
be prepared to wait a really long time
no problems
she had to wait 3 hours
3 hours! just to wait
this treatment is unacceptable
be sure to get there really really early
and bring a good book
and some really strong sedatives
the worst business practices ever
very poor customer service! be prepared to wait
the scheduled pick up time does not matter
customer is not right here
the reviews are consistent
always enjoy the staff at elmonte lv @ boulder hwy
always quick in and quick out
sandra and will are beyond professionals
clean & reliable motorhomes every time
i showed up at 2p and there was no rv
we did not  leave the lot till 6p
well no call from judy
i called on wed
and she had not even looked at the notes
on a positive note
##warning##i rented an rv on the 25 of june 2018
they told me they released my deposit
and of course i would never put one myself
they ignore me completely and stole my money
no other way to put it
i highly recommend not to rent there
it completely ruined my honey moon
just finished my second rental with el monte
such a great experience
we reserved a rental to take to zion in late july
well it was not
we were told it would be a 1
5 hour wait
went to get lunch and came back
by 1:00 there was absolutely no update
three plus hours wasted
you wo not  be disappointed
- philip b
had a reservation for 1pm
there is a wait list with a 5 hour wait
you have  been warned
this was my first time renting an rv
it was a breeze from start to finish
i chose to rent the 22ft leprechaun
it was a 2017 and in perfect condition
you are renting only the rv
drop off was even easier
i rented in february
i was here 3 different days with no lines
i would rent again from el monte rv
we scheduled our reservation 3 weeks ago
never again
overall we had a positive experience
rv was reasonably clean and well maintained
understaffed and incompetence
find a different rv rental
they are the most shady rv rental in las vegas
i contacted the location and spoke with sandra
no one contacted me in the morning
she said there was nothing she could do
00   they would try to retain my business
i guess that  why they only have 2 stars on yelp
sincerely  jason a
i was not the only one so furious
this place sucks
now for the negatives
another annoyance was about the rv age
rv rental is not a walk-in business
i rented an rv from la and dropped off in vegas
two nights only
renters beware
the more you do it  the easier it gets
none of these was unsolvable
it was 40 degrees at night and we froze to death
since  we were headed to moab we did not want to
spend our trip sitting at a service station
this place has bad customer service and junk rvs
so with this review you will loose much much more
we will definitely rent from el monte again!
the staff at el monte was wonderful to deal with
i highly recommend doing business with them
i would be very cautious about using el monte rv
-pickup took 4+ hours
stay away!  i used to love el monte rv
you definitely get what you pay for
i asked why the 2 hr and 45 minute wait
after 3 hrs i get the rv
another hr fix
finally we are on our way
get to camping
stunk like sewer all weekend
bad! we slept with our faces out of the window
so unprofessional
the online was reservation was simple to complete
we called to confirm
he made the long experience more pleasant
very friendly
give this man a raise
we rented a 30ft rv for a 2500 mile trip
we arrived to pick up the rv at 4:00pm
kudos to lisa at roadside group
not true  we had no hot water
we were not  told this
also  green algae came out of the shower head
we had to buy one at wal-mart
luckily we were not  in the middle of nowhere
they sent out a mobile repair to fix it
would i rent here again  probably not
the staff were cheerful  friendly  and helpful
save your money  do not  rent from them
never agin elmonte!!!
the guys here were great
also got me the bed rug at a great price
bought a small travel trailer from tom
matt was our salesman and was great
very no-pressure and helpful with any questions
matt faxed it to me in no time
thanks toms camperland!
we had a very good experience with toms camperland
it was just a loose wire
the props that hold the door up have failed
would  not recommend them
what kind of reputable dealer would do that
this shell was an are v-series
thank you matt for selling me a great product!
wo not  ever go back there
be careful
in reality  the lines pop up 2
5-3 times the height of the hood
sticks out like a sore thumb
can i return? nope
like i said  do your research before hand
i did not  and i got burned
such a great experience shopping for trailers here
helpful  no-pressure  no-rush
salesman dave was great
my understanding was they had some to spare
he then proceeds to ask for the covers back
i returned the covers and left the store
of course  how could you  go wrong  with  a lance
thank you tom  camperland
the team at tom  camperland are the best
keep up the good work guys  you are the best !
these guys are fantastic
i will definitely buy from them again
this should have never happened
toms camperland sucks
these people do not know what they are doing
i give you no stars at all!
he could not
i never got a call back
my first ríp off experience
called they send a over weight old man limping
looked homeless the van looked like junk
evil ass people trying to make money with scams
pathetic ! i will not let it go and file a report
he said he would  send someone over
the rate would be $85
no answer
ask again  he said it will  be a few hours
"""  he started packing up his laptop and van"
that was fine with me
i guess they do not  teach that in school anymore
tl:dr do not  use this company
sketchy business practices
lack of car knowledge
i would not suggest this company
he fixed my belt and that was that
10 or 10 would recommend! (:
i highly recommended place
2 years ago they fixed my brake and signal lights
good honest place
i have to echo laura m
post below
same experience: took far longer than promised
i furnished don  d
i could have used my car those 11 days
this was distressing as i keep my suv spotless
i no longer have any confidence in don  d
thanks  yelp!
def thumbs up!
bmw dealer shop conned me in the past
i had to find a honest repair shop
thanks to yelp i found one
they are very busy and that  good sign
i will  be back again
i have nothing good to say about this shop
they said it was a broken hose and repaired it
2 days later it overheated again
nice work  don
0 stars for us
we have a 1995 suburban 4×4
we heard a hundred different stories
the right hand never knew what the left was doing
when we were picking up our truck
we had to drive through town to get there
now here  the ringer
shame on you!
these guys are amazing
but well worth the trip
never recommending my family and friends here
a+ in my book
i got to the shop right when they opened
that was not  the case here
he did not  try to take my money at all
very honest shop!
"""scratch my head"" but okay  if that  it go ahead"
00 problem solved
stay away from don  di automotive!
i called in every other day just to check up
helped me survive the scorching las vegas heat
out the door for less than $300
not these guys
19 days and $825 i finally have my car back
"apparently ""help"" means $15 off"
i will never go there again
fast  efficient and reasonable
they lie to ypu about what is  wrong with it
they are my main guys i will be using for now on
recommended
i could not  ask for anything more
this place is atrocious
please do not waste your time or money here
here is a timeline
"paul   would say  ""i will call you by 3:00"
this happened constantly
we begin contacting our warranty company
paul tells me to come down and pay
5 or 8- i call paul and ask if the turbo arrived
i ask when i can expect the truck to be done
it is not
5 or 15- i show up at the shop
he immediately realizes that the turbo is broken
in my original e-mail i requested that he call me
either way  do not bring your vehicle there
it  the new yorker in me
i have a dodge durango r or t
i drover to don  di and explained my issue
lovely people  straight forward and to the point
thank you guys!  great work!
brought my car in with a control panel issue
brought it in and signed off on the replacement
i was told the car would be done by 6 that day
"after 3 days the car was ""fixed"""
started the car and the issue was not fixed
would not  recommend it and will not go back
honest and very nice
we definitely needed a mechanic asap
so yelp came in handy and we found this shop
pricing is decent
you were very nice
these guys are fast and awesome
e searing heat destroying the ac
anyways thanks again for helping us
cheersnick
it took my car 1 month to get it repaired
that  the best we can do
at this point i flipped out and said what
you are kidding me
as i drove on di to go home
thank you eric
not a good sign  it took the entire day
at least they provided free shuttle service
i could not  believe it
they could not  believe it
the place looks like a auto shop should lol
great place in town hands down
went here to get my check engine light off
never going back
eventually i got my car back after 15 days
never give this company a down payment
i was quoted $2400
00 for a rebuilt transmission and brake rebuild
00 for the transmission and $600
00 for the brakes
i was told i would have to put $1600
they have kept my car for eight months
i have to now scrap the car
i understand that i will have to eat the $600
00 for brakes
that leaves a balance of $1000
00 owed me
they will not return my money
my contact at desert auto  paul will not help me
he will not give me a number to call
another nightmare
read less
just be prepared for what you pay for
cheap work
it was dusk
it  to bad i ca not  give negative ratings
you will be wasting your time and money here
i took an rv to them with two issues
a vibration in the engine and no dash air
this is after $3k to them
dont go here
my complaint was hard starting
their diagnosis was a bad fuel pump
i called paul at don  d
above and beyond  thanks for saving our vacation
i had my classic rolls royce repaired here
i will be back!
also  be careful
thanks for the save guys!
00 dollars
they are awesome
it was close to 120 degrees at the time
my wife  son and i were miserable
the next day i got the call that it was minor
the system was leaking and some seals were bad
it was fixed before the end of the day
they are very professional and wonderful people
they really saved my vacation
i brought my vehicle in for repairs on a tuesday
just a warning
5 hours of labor
i was dumb struck
great work  and if you can  work with tino!
great guy right off the bat
marcia waldorf and nolan greene
they fixed my daughters bmw at a reasonable price
i was always kept in the loop
overall a++
thanks unlimited! highly recommend
we highly recommend unlimited collision and rv
they made the entire thing quick and painless
david was awesome
i highly recommend this shop
everybody here takes care of you
i mean everybody!
did not  realize the glue was on my tail light to
they took the extra step and clean this off too
highly approve this body shop
this is a revised review
i have used this company 3 times now
this is a revised review
i have used this company 3 times now
i am disappointed
both nightstands would drag along the floor
pro:  this company is no joke
be patient
hopefully your experience was better than mine
i arrived at the facility on 17 june
matt asked if i would be leaving the coach
color me confused
gotta say  this finally got to me
seriously
and  he told me to leave his premises
i told him i wanted the service he advertized
he said he would call the police
well  that day  my plan was for an estimate
it took about an hour for the policeman to arrive
matt  the owner and sales guy? not
brand new f250 black
i will  defiantly refer fam and friends
special thanks to david:) you truly rock!!!
we have had very good service from affordable rv
their work has always been satisfactory
we are very happy with this company
we found the gear box had broke
simply - do not  bother
i spoke to mike
no call back
tried again after 10:00
at 10:15 called again  he picked up  then hung up
tried  once more later  and no luck
a few hours later  discount rv came to the rescue
quick  courteous  and helpful
i strongly recommend them
not even a call back
really  really  poor performance
they call us back earlier than scheduled
guess what? yup  they called hubby
so he had to call me to tell me it was ready
so i go up there to pick it up
they tell me  oh credit card? extra 4%
nope  it  a debit card
oh  debit card extra 2%
bullshit
in a sketchy part of town
the parts arrived in 2 days as promised
what can i say
they absolutely refuse any money
thank you so much guys
full quote was $4500 to replace everything
today i started the demolition of the same area
i cannot say enough good things about this place
we depend on our rv for our business
if we are not going we are not making money
not only do they go above and beyond
you just do not  find places like this anymore
this is not the place for you
smart smart guy
allie and al are really great!
the work was clean and efficient
happy hal  and james are a six ****** company
thanks happy hal !  stan b
i believe the work they did was excellent
customer service from emily and gordy was amazing
thank you
i had a good experience with happy hal
the rates were reasonable
recommend this repair service
punctual and polite
btw  his rate was not $130 per hour
it was $100 per hour  and well worth it
our tech  gordy was friendly & helpful
called to let me know he was in his way
he arrived about 8:30
our window was between 8:am and 11:am
james is an absolute gem
excellent for its age that is
james from happy hals is beyond knowledgeable
highly recommend
i will only call them when i need help
i even drove him to go get parts
the heater had a $20
finally an honest company to deal with on repairs
r&r monaco
danny & kathy
all this right at our site
i would  give him 6 stars  but it  not an option
i recommend happy hal  for your rv repairs
will always call him when i need rv repair
the best rv repair i have found
10:30 came and went
again i called emily
he arrived just over an hour late
the mechanic showed up not knowing what i wanted
the mechanic was good
he answered all my questions
he also changed the air filter and fuel filter
he never did look at the chassis
i am giving you 3 stars
great service - gordie came out on time1
fixed the hydraulic leak in my jacks2
replace stair motor3
replace springs on all four jacks4
from beginning to end  this was as good as it gets
this would cost about $2 000
seriously
call happy hals first
he serviced our onan generator
his tips on routine maintenance were invaluable
i would like to update my review
he knew right off what the problem was
especially matt
definitely go somewhere else  anywhere else
sincerely  tim allenbluebird freight llc
i paid my deposit
- selected another vehicle
- selected another vehicle
- one month later it died
do not waste your time or money with these people
they are so rude
i am tired of calling these guys
they dont answer your phone  emails
great place to stay and camp
this was a great little campground
we called ahead and lady was very nice
nice price for 50 amp service
no cable or satellite tv  but they have sewer
the shower was terrific
they are in separate rooms with a toilet and sink
lots of hot water
the site had trees and was level
they are big long sites
only downside we saw was it  next to a busy road
the restroom had 1 toilet and 3 sinks
no cable or satellite tv
it  a nice stop over
joseph where there are incredible antique shops
a the next day
i arrived 10 minutes before noon on a monday
the rv was outside waiting for me the entire time
i could have drove to l
dropping the rv off in l
a was a breeze  took 5 minutes
you know what  i am  completely impressed
best time of our lives in a nice rv!
a very good overall experience
we are thinking about buying an rv now
if you have any question drop me a note
we loved it
the staffs were friendly and courteous
the vehicle was clean and new
the price was the lowest we can find
they were very accommodating
all all  we had a great experience
this is a great place to rent an rv
will definitely rent from apollo again
so much better than el monte!
wir hatten die gelegenheit
very poor customer service
horrible horrible horrible experience
but the worst are hidden fees
customer service is a joke
i walk into the office at 2:45 p
as i was advised pick-up time is between 12 p
vera is behind the desk
"she responds ""ok"
absolutely awful
nope  not even a thanks or goodbye
however  the staff is very unprofessional
just the facts:sept 7th  monday  12:30pm
in vegas to fill it up
literally across the street
everyone was warned
do not  waste your time with this company
we wasted way too much time with them
find another dealer
they were great! :)beware of the following: 1
we wasted a whole day of our trip or vacation
40 or mile if you do not  get a mileage package
suggestion: get the mileage package
we def wo not  return to apollo
this office located in las vegas
customer service is very bad
check-in process it takes couple hours
we are customers of many years
and for us this situation was surprised
what happens?????  new management or
change the workers
do something  please
worst time in my life
we felt really squished in our site
all the paperwork seemed slow
due to everything running in the slow paper mode
great stay!  grounds were immaculate
food at the restaurant next door was really tasty
the check in clerk was friendly and helpful
bathrooms were very clean and spacious
i would stay here again!
we found the bathrooms were nice and clean
i will stay here again
clean  friendly  and roomy rv sites
great salt water pool  clean showers and laundry
pros:  clean
decent amenities
seems secure
cons: wifi is non existent
the rv park is gated with remotes for tenants
the bathrooms were clean and secure
there are two dog runs and a doggie bath area
friendly staff nice level pull through sites
laundry room was huge
would certainly stay again
we stayed here for a total of 3 nights
it says there is free wifi
"it is very ""finicky"""
once it said i was connected i thought i was good
i said we need to have it before we come back
he assured me they did and there were no issues
we really liked it overall
staff is friendly and helpful
they dog runs with a dog wash area
bathrooms are clean and secure
we stayed 3 days and enjoyed our stay
he was a total sweetheart
i would deffidently come back
the bathrooms are clean and the pool is nice
good food and good prices
would definitely recommend to a friend!
love this park
very secure
great people
level pads
we will come back here again and again
laundry room is great and clean
bebe loved the dog park
and has a bar and restaurant with great food
it is one of the better deals in las vegas
they keep it reasonably clean
yes it is insane
i have to be honest
we found this with the all stays rv app
it  not the best neighborhood
great food and quantity at a more than fair price
hitchin post rv park
is top notch
it provides all the ammendities
and i rated this place 4 stars
i will concede the park is clean and well kept
the only grass in the park
it  so urine soaked it  disgusting
free internet is not free
you have to buy an adapter for $30 to use it
also  we are under the nellis afb flight pattern
gray  dusty  gravel dirt everywhere
pet area very small
very sweet and helpful!keep driving
close to i-15
very clean
gated and secure
level sites with cable and wifi
friendly and helpful owners
good place to stay when traveling the i-15
could be larger
sites are level and big enough
camp has a security gate with remote access
a good feature
restrooms are clean
"a full page of ""your questions answered"" vs"
"large showers 60"" or some with even tubs"
bagged iceberg so points for that
sometimes rockin'
sometimes not
neither of those statements are true
military  aaa and goodsam discounts provided
diner offered military discounts for food
the park itself is quite clean
excellent access to major freeways
"secondly are the ""dog parks"""
what the heck
dog parks for tiny stuffed animals
the looks on their faces was priceless
that  ok  we like walking
great clean place to stay
bathrooms are super clean
laundry is clean
sites are gravel and well kept
mail service available
we stayed in a travel trailer
friendly folks for sure!
totally recommend this park
in a dirty part of vegas
horrible! do not waste your time
clean bathrooms is about it here
not really nice to walk around with kids
however clean and well maintained
also  no wifi  no ice machine
i did not  need to use the air conditioner
jen at the front desk was friendly and helpful
00 for seniors  children  and matinee showings
the amenities are fantastic
the dog wash was really great
i had a serious case of dirty dog
i enjoyed my stay
i would and have recommended this park to others
we made it home finally
thanks for saving us!
the real test was my recent trip to burning man
every trip with klank is a learning experience
i am a satisfied customer
be careful
not rv professionals
but it was just that
communications mix-up
so no biggie
i know this is a passionate team
the manager was very concerned about the review
i would go to these guys again without hesitation
i pull it with my explorer
i am  always amazed how much room there is inside
it has everything that i need
thanks dune sport
so here we go
overall it was adequate and that was about it
no pad or plastic on the angle iron to prevent it
the salesman said yes
i did not  believe it
which i know
but not every two seconds
that is something binding
i had to tell him to come out
he then listened and said yep its not right
and it needed to be replaced
it de-escalated finally
i was furious
the finance team is 5 stars
that was an a little much
but they have bent over backwards to help
i would not return here for a product
this was my first experience
we may have just had lots of bad luck
i ca not  speak to the 5th wheels
we had the 26ft mancave bumper pull
it made trying to find the right hauler easy
they added a led light strip for us
see below in misses
had to get the manager to listen
we have a dark brown unit with black accents
and every door is white or light grey
told a free led awning light  due to mix up
but was charged anyway
make sure you see it added to the order form
double check
everything before accepting the unit
casey was very good with my questions and ideas
thank you
i have been out for 3 trips and love the unit
it pulled good with my explorer
my friends are amazed how roomy it is inside
with the taller ceiling  it feel larger
thanks brad and casey for taking care of me
these guys are great
their rvs and vehicles are clean and top notch
their service is outstanding
i had an issue while out on the trip
left a message
ca not  recommend them enough
they certainly could have but did not
do not hesitate to rent from these guys
both gentlemen were friendly and pleasant
she was very professional
we were 2 women from australia travelling alone
there was no spare tyre on the vehicle
i know now where to service and buy my next rv
its worth the trip to their dealership
wonderful experience all the way through
will definitely use them again
just for the record  i hate writing bad reviews
but people need to know
the sales process was fantastic
my gripe is the service after the sale
i called in early july to schedule service
they are that backed up
i was told they only have 1 mechanic
and all the other stuff that needs to be fixed
never again
he said i received such a low price no battery
no battery for a trailer with a power lift
lee or leigh  picked me up at caesar
during the ride i rode with both casey and dustin
went to lv for a weekend trip
unexpected adventure
being motorcyclists we love that adrenalin rush
this tour did it all
pickup was easy
guides and sweep were great
thrilling
ca not  wait to do it again
price point perfect
kenny was the best guide
he went above and beyond!
reservation online so easy
pick up and drop off included in price
there and back in las vegas is hard
it is hot funky  dirty  hot  bumpy  rough
my tip sunny buggy is worth it!
my two teenage girls just loved it
paul was a wonderful guide
thanks for a great day
took photos and had bottled water for us
i had a blast with this
the guides kept a great pace for the group going
i removed one star for this
but much more
maybe a 30 minute drive from downtown las vegas
directions on their website make it easy to find
this place is kid friendly too
service: the guides are super friendly
if you get a private tour
definitely coming back for the private tour!!!!!
if you want to try something fun in las vegas
las vegas razor adventures is the place to go
we went on a 2 hour razor tour
everything is provided to you
we had a blast!
the staff were friendly & incredibly patient
my friend and i had a great time
razor adventures is the best above the rest
mark was a great leader
i had my bachelor party here and it was amazing
sorry only a 2
in about 45 minutes my friend burnt the used belt
me  i lasted until the trip was almost over
we limped back to the starting area
the day was over
fun time vs break down time
you pay for it all
got to say for the $$$ i expected more
there will also be reserve rigs off to the side
that  to bad to
"you are ""on the clock"" from the start"
excellent day out in the desert
landen and jake made for a great afternoon
thanks for a great time today
special shout out to casey and jeff!
second time with lvra on a work off-site
great time with these guys
i would  highly recommend them for a good time
super friendly and knowledgeable staff
this is vegas and we had two guys not show up
the tour guide was hilarious a+
i really liked how professional this company was
my family and i had a great time sunday
he is a good driver
keep up the great work all and it was so much fun
thank youd
corona  ca
picked up promptly for our 8:30am reservation
our guides were great
getting stuck in sand
push the pedal to the medal and ride!
ok  now to the good part
rocks  gullies  the course ran the gamut
thanks guys!
so fun!  recommend this for any age
the actual tour is a blast
lots of fun in the desert
pick up st my hotel was right on time
i would definitely  recommend this to anyone 16+
if you have a go pro  bring it
"""  i was skeptical  and said let me call you back"
"""  yeah right!  i decided to go with someone else"
do not  waste your time
skip this place
the day
but  that is another story
they owe me $525 from overpayment on my trade
its in the mil
or will be mailed
very poor walk through
thought it was automatic like my trade
water fill does not work
george cossitt
i wo not  go to sun city rv again
what a disaster
do not  trust them
thank you sun city rv!
instead they made a loyal and satisfied customer!
we drove the 20 hrs to az to pick up the trailer
it was 6:00 pm and sun city was closed
jim & nicole s
we did a stupid thing
they kept us in the loop the entire time
we are totally satisfied
*thank you for visiting with us at suncityrv
peoria  az 85345
peoria  az 85345
i thank you all for such a wonderful experience
i would  like to say i would  see you again but
lol   thank you for all the jobs well done
i stored my rv here for for months this winter
i would have to
they are great and work with you
could not  be happier
i will  always try this place first
these guys are awesome
a very friendly husband and wife locals operation
the jet ski i rented was very fast and very safe
i dropped it back off and they unhooked it
5 stars is not enough for this company
keep up the great work
:) i will be back soon
we had a terrible experience to pick up our rv
awful experience
"""  i had his cell and he always answered"
fantastic diesel mechanic with fair prices
i will be back for all my trucks needs
i am very happy with the results
danny is honest and sticks to his quote
i can hold a gear much longer now
danny is the man to beat in the phoenix area
i am very happy with the results
danny is honest and sticks to his quote
we decided to get a 2nd opinion
turns out it was electrical related not fuel
very unprofessional and unorganized shop
i never did receive any diagnostic codes
i do not  think it was ever done
"and i still had to pay $110 for this ""diagnosis"""
and it cost me a total of $88
00 plus the coolant i already had
glad we found him!
i have to say at gregs customer service is great
there is not the blend motor he thought was there
greg was fantastic to work with
our sliding door motor needed replaced
he  worked on my husband  work vehicles as well
highly recommend him
i 100% recommend this place for service
many thanks to greg and his team
this repair shop is great to work with
they are very honest and trustworthy
extremely satisfied
my car brakes smoothly and quietly now
thanks greg!
really nice  clean place
service was great and fast
answer all my questions
would not recommend this park
my partner and i travel the country by rv
so trust me when i say that i know rv places
the whole rv park is nothing but concrete
so it does tend to stay hot around the day
the dog park is all gravel
the park has no grass
our spot was just as if we parked at walmart
even the premium spots have no grass
most of the park is just one big parking lot
stay elsewhere while in vegas
this park is over rated and costly
i would definitely return
older park  but well kept
made me feel very secure
laundry small  but very clean
advice - wash after noon
good luck!
the bike was brand new and very expensive
could not wait to get out of las vegas!!
super clean and organized showers and laundry
perhaps a shaded sim lawn area
but  that being said  this resort is a winner!
nice area for pets
staff is friendly
i feel safe when staying here
nice people and amenities
we only stayed 2 nights
reasonable price
we would stay there again
i stayed here back in august of this year
that said  i would come back here
very clean and organized park
we will  stay here again!
we really enjoyed our stay
the employees are all helpful and friendly
they offer as much or as little help as you need
we usually bypass las vegas
it  a good place
it  clean  safe and quiet
it  just not in the best part of town
this is a small clean rv resort
i am  going to make this quick
controlled access in  guards  and well lit
great idea
quiet resort  not a lot of occupants
it is very close to walmart and sam  town
recently stayed one night
restrooms and clubhouse  excellent
the deluxe sites are large and comfortable
but will come back next trip to lv
i had a terrible experience with this park today
i chose this place for security reasons
i recommend arizona charlie !
it  very secure and very pet friendly
19mb download speed and 0
18mb upload speed
i just checked again and the download is 0
i went for a long swim this morning
the pool was immaculate and the area very quiet
thank you!
i love this place
you will not be disappointed
we have stayed at this park a number of times
the staff are nice and friendly
one is really long and good for big dogs
there is also a leashed area
laundry is good  there are two
the whole park is quite clean
security comes around regularly
better than sams town koa and many others
we stayed here on our way headed to montana
we will be staying here on our way home again
totally recommend
the security was good
the tengointernet did not  work
my reference number for my complaint was 253063
treat paying folks with goodness
great rv resort
enjoyed our stay very much
this park is fabulous
it  clean  well lit and the jacuzzi is hot
next year we want to come back for 2 months
i have been at las vegas rv resort for a year now
partner and i always enjoy our stay here
third time was a charm
staff is very friendly
facilities are kept clean
one of the cheapest rv parks to do laundry at
nice pool and jacuzzi
a couple of dog parks
die umgebung ist nicht gerade perfekt
wir waren nur eine nacht dort
alles gut und sicher :)
things just did not  start well here
we try to stay at the nicest facility in the area
this is probably number 2
staff were very friendly
my dachshund was very ill and required vet care
this could be your spot
all star rv park
very clean  quiet  24 hour patrolled park
pool and hot tub were awesome
our stay was about 40 days
highly recommended
will stay here again if we are in town
wifi worked well
loved the 24 hour security
would definitely stay here again!
all in all  this is a nice secure park
some older trailer type rvs  but no riffraff
24 hour  security  and a great pool and spa
the office closes at 4:00 pm  sharp
the park was easy to get in and out of
the pool and clubhouse were awesome
00 nightly
it was very quiet at night
i did not  even realize anyone was around us
it  pretty quiet at nite
it  not that far from us 93 or 95
"this ""resort"" is far from it"
rude and unhelpful lady at office desk
we were escorted to our site
our site had a picnic table and full hook up
the restrooms near the pool were really clean
getting anywhere was easy with uber
the rv resort was quiet
we stayed here for 5 days
this one had plenty of space for our rv and truck
wifi was hit or miss
campground is pretty quiet after 10pm
we would stay if pass through this way again
we did not use any facilities
this is a great park for traveling through
easy to find  and great freeway access
both north and south
reservation was confirmed by email
check in was flawless and the park is spotless
just barely
for me to get the rig and toad on site
i had to forgo hooking up the sewer
with hook ups
we camped at las vegas rv resort in a motorhome
length of stay  6 nights
photos of lot 331 attached
rude and horrible experience
you are  crazy!
i was treated like a valued customer
but for a camper  rv or trailer
there was no problem with that
but all the underlying water damage is horrific
what a liar he is
that is his job to know about it
it is his reputation on the line
i would not recommend this place to anyone
this place is a graveyard for rv
go somewhere else
i step inside the rv and the filth continues
at this point i was over test driving it
my initial order was on may 23
i needed a hd3000mh allison transmission
before you buy new  check here
seriously just go look
visone rv salvage
unlike this company!
he said i had to wait till monday to order it
while on hold she reversed my charge
i called back and they were very very rude to me
the staff is so rude
i would give it a zero rating if i could
they let us look through everything
i am  so glad we found them!
shot these guys an email and got a quick reply
shipped them to me in ca
in short time
could not  be happier with the service
i definitely recommend az
we will definitely be back!
place is cool
we rented two skis for the day
they ran well and so did the tow truck
it ran very nice
we will be back in april!!!!!
i will  definitely be coming back!
trailer was inspected and hooked and off we went
definitely will be coming back!
i can not say enough great things about this place
this place was great
very reasonably priced
had a great time on lake mead
thanks skiwi
great customer service
enjoyed 4 jet skis yesterday with friends
would definitely come back
great people
you feel like family
great work honest prices
creig is awesome man
a man of his word hard to find in vegas
they made a new customer and friend
very personable guys
i will absolutely rent again from them
cheapest place to get a sea doo
thanks a lot for great experience!
we would definitely rent from craig in the future
they make it fast  easy and fun!
"rodger led me out to the ""treasure chest"
they are  always friendly and professional
we are  so glad we found them years ago
i highly recommend you rent from here
a classy place
the prices are better then everyone else around
they are always polite  nice  helpful
highly recommend skiwi!!!
i must give credit where credit is do
fast forward to the return
this place sucks and they lie
so this skiwi rental place flat out lied to us
go with vegas jet ski rental
the guys were real professional and informative
i will  continue to rent from them hopefully soon
the prices here are the best in town
we rented a jet ski
that  awesome we enjoyed it all evening
boat and truck ran great
highly recommended; we will  be back soon
skiwi jet ski rentals is awesome
their prices are great and my jet ski was cherry
i always love getting a discount
before we knew it  we were at lake mead
i would highly recommend using them for rentals
they also offer boats to rent for the day
i just might try that next time!  thanks skiwi!
this truly is as good as it gets
we arrived to skiwi rentals around 8am
i dont argue and pay the total
so now were ready
thus it was a cadillac  it was completly filthy
this rope was nylon and had a loop at the end
the whole process is extremely straight forward
ca not  speak more highly about skiwi rentals
i expect to use them again
craig and his wife were great
they discussed and mapped places to go
their service enhanced our day!
looks like the boat just came out of the factory
i was very happy with the service of this company
very happy and will rent from them again
we rented a yamaha 21ft and enjoyed it
this is the place to go
this place had great service
we rented a 21ft boat with no issues
much better prices than anywhere on the water
highly recommended
they ran perfect all day
they had plenty of power like we were promised
the machines were also in great shape
george did an amazing job on my car
they fit me in same day
dropped it off at my work
i could not  have asked for better
thanks george this is kelly rom blu sushi
thx george!!!
excellent work
brought my 13 yr old truck in to prep for sale
he is at mcfall tire and auto
13564 w van buren st  goodyear  az 85338
highly recommended
very nice to deal with
got a 20 foot flatbed a few months ago
had a warranty issue
they covered it no hassle and very quick
highly recommended
until i pulled in phoenix trailer sales
not knowing to much about a trailer
custom built and rolled away a week later
found what i wanted and the price
deal done  it was that easy
thanks edpaul b from maricopa  az
great service  i will  be back for sure
his customer service was off the charts
extremely recommend phoenix trailer to anybody
amazing service thanks again
the whole process was excellent
i purchased an 77 or 12
smooth experience
thank you!
traveling from arizona to las vegas
not divine  or  michelangelo transportation !!!!!
this airport limo service is oustanding
she was sparkling whole day
do not send your child to her day care
do not take your kids there
calls day before installation
says he ca not  find it
i will absolutely use them in the future
thanks so much for caring about us and our trip
fantastic repair service
we have traveled over 10 000 miles
they are on time
they communicate
their people are knowledgeable and friendly
they know what they are doing
so  i know it got done and got done right
could not  have been more pleased
i would definitely call asap again
however again  this is right near a school
dan completed some warranty work on my motorhome
dan is extremely conscientious about his work
he was also very friendly and personable
service rates were also reasonable
i would definitely call him again!
i wonder if they sold their business?
we have  used joe  rv repair service twice
he  a very friendly but serious fellow
he has over 25 years experience and it shows
this is a bargain
let me explain
if joe ca not  fix it
you have a big problem
oh yeah  he fixes those too
but here  the best part you guys
i was very pleased with their service
we bought our aerolite 282 there in december '16
everything was excellent
so glad we went to golden gait for our 1st rv
beautiful rvs but terrible service
just purchased a horse trailer from golden gait
everyone was very courteous and professional
thanks for all your help!
everyone there   was friendly
the buying experience was great and quick
no hassles  just straight honest sales
ca not  wait to take it out camping
in this dealership it is the exact opposite
deric answered all of my questions and then some
mention my name and get 75% off any rv
nevada rv people are nice
as soon as we drove away had problems
the ac would not blow cold air
the refrigerator would not cool
there was a window screen missing
stay away
it was love at first sight
they are  ideal for 1 to 2 adults
the very best in class service and experience
integrity is their middle name
a rare gem to find in the auto repair industry
need i say more? the best!!
a guy recommend i take it to champs
i figured why not
i was really lucky to find my way here
definitely recommend this shop!!!!
the place is nice and the workers are friendly
things i would like others to beware of
first  you will overpay for parts
that is the major downfall of dealing with them
that is a good sign
nice people though
wish them the best
definitely a shop worth going back to
first time for me here
thanks guys i will be back
i love family businesses !!!!
professional  exceeded expectations
their prices are unbeatable
josh and chris  complete professionals
a  they understood
made it to l
a and back with no problems
i will  be going back to champs on the regular
so back to champs
he said ok
the wiring harness was forced on and broken
so this repair cost me another 300
that was it
but did not happen
a great price  great people and great service
i did receive the check today
i wanted to thank champ for doing this
not many shops would have done that
thanks again for your help in this matter
happy camper
the owner  champ  was fantastic
my initial reaction
customer for life!
took my expedition here for some work
unknowingly  i okayed for it
stay away!!!
we recently took a trip to arizona
champs is were you need to go
thank you josh
highly recommend!
i have no idea how this business got good ratings
they left promising an estimate
that was five weeks ago
stay far  far away
i love this place
they give honest opinions & good advice
ask for chad
they need to clone that guy
jason  richard  and rocky took great care of me
thanks guys
the title process was terrible
but then stopped returning calls or trying to help
but their actions were quite the opposite
great place
nice moves cassone ! totally recommended
charged a $500 fee for delivery
he actually said that to a customer
i was not told of known issues with the rv
they will not call you back
we did not  inspect it as we should have
five star customer service
also  we had the wheels and brakes checked
he is very knowledgeable and hands-on
it was fresh smelling and every inch shined
we will be returning customers
thanks!
please really consider purchasing from them
the quality of their service tech was exceptional
pick up the phone!!
we had a 24 foot camper we wanted to consign
tess came and inspected it
she went over the consignment agreement with us
it only took a couple months for it to sell
jason worked hard to get the sale
we feel we got a reasonable price for it
thank you to all at cassones
do not  buy anything from these crooks!
fast and friendly service
very affordable prices
thanks again dell
i will definitely be back
very polite staff
i will be back
i was charged $10
95 for labor  an extra $6 for an oil filter   $6
11 shop supply fee  $10 disposal fee
when all was said & done it was a total of $82
54 & he deducted $39
99 for the groupon and charged me $43
he yelled at me and hung up
i will  definitely come back in the future
very fast  quality work
very friendly
also ask for andy
i feel like we have been conned by these guys
found on groupon and had an amazing experience
would definitely recommend!
friendly staff and fast service
got a good deal on groupon for oil change
they scratched my car
dont lie about it
honesty is everything!
it also said that some vehicles might cost more
"do not  fall for their ""deals"""
less than 1 star if i could do it
looks bad for the resort!
he is a nice guy  too
highly recommended
great service and reasonably priced
we would definitely use him again
thank you mark !! :)
this is the way service should be given
we called and mark showed up on time
the repair was done quickly and professionally
we highly recommend discount
this is the second time renting from them
we will definitely be renting again
the teardrop is setup to make it very convenient
easy to tow and looks really cool
but that  way more than i would ever need to camp
or so i thought
absolutely superbly done
i was truly impressed
third  towing the trailer was incredibly easy
my vehicle performed virtually the same
fourth  as comfortable as my bed at home
which says a lot
i love my bed at home
easily there is room for two adults
the second night i also stayed dry
fifth  cooking is easy
thank you!
it  hard to find this kind of customer service
we enjoyed it
hardly noticed it was there
all were very impressed!
it surprises me
i am a pilot
sometimes i land at airports after hours
they have no on site security cameras either
total scam
they have no on site security cameras either
total scam
they now have a d- from the bbb
do not rent from them!
do not rent from this place
take pictures of everything
even if there  no damage
it was a pleasure to drive  got 12
7 miles to the gallon   from road bear
you have no soul! no soup for you
i would  recommend them in a heart beat
but they should improve their online experience
the return process was simple as well
rented a 26' rv for our trip to zion and bryce
we just got back from our first rv trip
thanks for a wonderful experience
the rv was spotless and well maintained
we rented an rv for 10 days
was perfect - it was brand new  flawless
the check in process was super easy
not much was there
we then needed to purchase all the essentials
very disappointed
great experience as usual
their rvs are always clean and ready to go
affordable and the check in and out is efficient
see you next year
i bought a moped through them for school
they said it would be here in 5 days
they offered me zero compensation
go to any other sports store but here
they do not  deserve your time or money!
thats my two cents
welcome to yelp q9
the prior owner could have notified me earlier
given this experience  i will never be back
thanks  phil and carolyn medina ohio
on delivery  the furnace fuse was blown
i called again on 9 or 21 or 2016
they offered technical assistance over the phone
could not open door from exterior
highly recommend!
"no hidden fees and ""dealer setup fees"""
i would recommend this dealership to anyone
keep up the good work avalon!
that place was avalon
buy from them and i doubt you will  regret it
see you next time buddy
great job
shane is a great dude and very knowledgeable
looking forward to working with him in the future
i absolutely loved this mechanic
very friendly and knowledgeable
shane was very helpful and prop
and for a fair price
thanks for the great work shane
like speedy gonzales
keep up the good work
very friendly and knowledgeable
i had one of the best experiences ever with them
they are my go to mechanic  from now on!!
i have used him twice now on two different cars
my name is jasmine this review is for shane
ammm saved the day
he made sure clean fluid was in every system
god bless!!!
really personable and caring
will never go back to a mechanic shop
npt open 24 or 7 as stated
soo all the mechanic just rerouted the cable
idk mechanics are liars
i got heat stroke doin all the work
bad bad company dont use!!!!
fixed my problem at a great price
give him a shot  i am  sure you wo not  regret it
i refuse to go to any other mechanic from now on
no matter where i live in the u
you guys or ladies are tops !
and they did it right
identical piece would have cost ~$50 on ebay
thanks guys you rock keep up the good work
power commanders rock !!!!!!
from modesto  california
nice people with good knowledge and experience
from driving through mud or on gravelled roads
this is not the way to make visitors come back!
do not rent here!!! they are rip off artists
took $350 from my initial deposit
do your self a favor and rent somewhere else
to start with  gas tank was 1 or 3 full
that was annoying  but minor
he changed his story several times
the next day he canceled
and he was not in the least apologetic
i would steer clear of this company
there are many other camper rentals around
this place is unprofessional and non-responsive
we had some issues finding the place
the bed was comfortable enough
we were always exhausted from hiking
the linens were soft and fresh smelling
the van was easy to drive and park
it  funny  our trip sounds a lot like lura s
trip on 10 or 25 or 2014
she walked through how to use everything
in the back
could not  figure out where that came from
we would  definitely rent one of these again
i have to agree with matt h
review on responsiveness and professionalism
they also offer a cheaper daily rental rate
it was nice to have the bathroom or shower
it was a truly memorable family trip
aj is awesome
i highly recommend insideout mobile rv repair
his price were very fair
fast  friendly  and a reasonable cost for repairs
reasonable price
boy am i glad that i did
he was professional  personable and efficient
thank you
i was very impressed with aj
we had an electrical problem  and had no lights
extremely professional and courteous
i would definitely call him again!
outstanding customer service
they came out to look at my rv ac units
i will  be back as a customer
i called aj and he responded quickly
we will call him again when the need arises
aj was great
i will use him again if i clog my macerater
great service & great rv tech
by far the best service ever
had them out to pack the bearings on two trailers
will have them out again next year
i have owned rv  since 2002 and currently own 2
prior to charging me
aj and his team are the best
aj just installed a new inverter for us
super reasonable and responsive
thanks again for keeping us in great running order
great service and more then fair pricing
they worked smart and very well as a team
this is an update on inside out rv
not sure how to rate this
no call  no message
very disappointed
lost my air conditioner in blythe
thank you aj!
he was extremely courteous and helpful
got to us asap and took care of the problem
would highly recommend this company!!!
sounds like a great guy
held me up in phoenix for over a week  so far
if you need it fixed  give aj a call
because of this i cannot recommend his services
i highly recommend daisy fresh
the price is reasonable and the result was great
robert is very personable and courteous
prompt and professional courteous service
i would highly recommend this place
another rv service that is so over priced
before he started this so
hope for the best for $ 175
00 it should be a nice surprise
he shlepped  half of it off on me to do
!! i like to help small buisness people help me
or  month
otherwise= the service is only worth $75
clay in service has been nothing but exceptional
edit: complete crooks
put $20k into both trucks
one of the owners is a complete cheat
go see them for a good deal
so we left and will not return
of well  lesson learned
thank you!!
the sales tactic was no pressure
clay our sales guy was awesome
they are very honest
there customer service is awesome
this is what buying an rv should be like!thanks!
fantastic team  fantastic prices!
very disappointed :(
these guys are the best in the business
no high pressure sales
first class all the way
i am now a customer for life
thank you everyone at rowley white rv
two week ago i picked up a surfside2250
this place has the best customer service
the buying experience was very easy and no b
i very much appreciate it
ca not  wait for our next jucy adventure!
so  keeping the fridge working was a hassle
we resorted to adding ice
the biggest disappointment was that k
we returned it after hours
the van worked great
there were 4 of us on the trip
at most we held about 3 1
it comes out into a small sink via a hand pump
swimming pool warm
the van also came with 4 folding camping chairs
it was tight  but it all fit
overall it was a great trip
the roof sleeper was more comfy than inside
fridge and burners were awesome
7 day rental  unlimited miles
decent on gas
it was an absolutely amazing trip
such a cool experience
we would certainly do it again
we turn the van off  and ca not  turn it on again
jucy is amazing
i will definitely be renting from jucy again!
thanks  nicole
and thanks  jucy!
we will  just know better next time
had a fantastic experience  will do that again!
also rented the bedding & kitchen package
smaller items would be best
-no usb port if you need to charge things
5 days of food
it  not provided
you could make it work though
bottom line
do it & have fun! look for groupons!
we turn the van off  and ca not  turn it on again
update--thank you for the reply
looking forward to hearing from you all soon!
great setup for 2 people for a weeklong trip
oh  and the van is very photogenic
the vehicle also supports 4 beds too
i ca not  thank you enough
great staff at the las vegas jucy pick-up spot
the concept is good and the marketing is fun
but the reality is
"the ""frig"" is a tiny drawer"
ours did not  work
two burners
one can of gas
batteries dead in key fob
dishes provided had old food stuck to them
no jumper cables provided
then 2 hour window to return it between 9-11
my husband and i were very happy up there
do not  even bother
it  a waste of money
one can will go a very  very long way
bring your own
poor customer service
used them twice  always an issue
will definitely be using this company again!
the van is the van
we originally planned this trip with four adults
two bailed out and that was a gift
i am  not sure how they did it
using the penthouse is kind of cumbersome
thank you  mike c
for the very comprehensive review of the vans
for our inconveniences
highly recommended to try them out!
great way to travel
car rental and hotel in one
i would use them again
excellent experience and customer service
they make this easy
highly recommend
thanks  tim!
kevin and jason were so helpful! they were awesome
second time coming here and i will sure be back!
i would recommend jucy to everyone around me
thanks jucy
tips: jucy has everything
this is money well spent
all the staff was very friendly and helpful
one day in sept we decided to downsize
thank you all!
very nice park with many  many activities
came here for spring training games
golf course in excellent condition
overall great experience
buyer beware
overall they are not a bad company
rented a 19foot for 5 days  to go to zion
i did all the reservation via email
pick was smooth
do not rent from these people
bogus in the extreme
picked up on gibson road in vegas
however there are a few things to note
let it thaw and were back in business though
belts whining  hard shifts  leaky exhaust noise
prices are fair
see you in the summer again !
they both were very polite and helpful
the total time took about an hour
it was very old and very worn
the return was equally as easy
would we rent from ca again - probably not
i think there are better options for us
we watched an orientation video
the lady who helped us was courteous and helpful
they supply a bucket
we needed a separate lighter to start the stove
the service is not good  here
corporate is not  any more useful
there  no good place to install a car seat
there are not latch anchors
nothing just works
i have yet to get the refrigerator to be cold
for what i am  paying  i expect more
a lot more
you should  too
we had a great experience
but nothing that got in the way of our trip
couple of tips to save frustration
we rented an rv to take to burning man
she was as pragmatic as he was
she pointed out a few areas that needed attention
i got defensive at one point and she cut me off
our extra charge was only $75
we paid it happily
the van we got was plain horrible
the vans are not maintained at all
all nights the camper was colder inside than out
i rented a 25 ft
this will be a memory to treasure
mary sue r
these two are exemplary employees
get more employees during high season
worst customer service ever
never book with cruise america
avoid at all costs
and in a good way!
no thanks
the guy was able to get it out
best attitude! thx
we rented a 30ft rv for the trip
there was an hour wait just to pick up the rv
the rv itself was clean and roomy
rented a 25' rv
we picked up a clean and ready to go rv
got deposit back smooth painless transaction
i would recomend this to any one
and if your thinking of purchasing one
very pleased
rented the compact rv for 4 days and it was great
definitely would rent from them again
here  maddi again with the review
only a three  it was a four at first  but no
just a three spot will do
this time it  cruise america in henderson
motor speedway exit
maybe it was because it was 1am
we ended up dumping at oasis rv park for $15
we returned the rv on february 28th
oh well i was out like 80 something dollars
trial and error
i know for next time
check in process was really simple
i was pleased with how simple everything was
stoves  showers  heating and air conditioning
i rented the standard 25 ft rv
zero communication  flat out rude service
five stars for how easy it was to work with her
it left a good final impression
so far no good
we rented this think months in advance
this was a very disappointing experience
our group rented a total of 5 rv
of the 5  1 was rented from the competition
of the 4 rv   3 had generator problems
all 4 were unacceptable for rental
there were various problems
we ended up with no air
oh  and the toilet did not  work
we called and they said a plumber would come
he did not
he must not have ever come back
cruise america   or not along our planned route
once we got there  our rv was still not ready
i reserved our rv almost 3 months in advance
their website says 11am pick up
i was finally told we could pick by about 1pm
when we showed up the line moved fast
we said yes
he then handed us our keys
the man just said see wear and tear
mind you the leak was before we hooked up
no apology no credit for renting a $700 tent
i am a first time pop-up camper owner
took in a second hand unit that i had bought
so for that i was charged $120
very happy with the outcome
highly recommend east valley rv specialists
8 returns for the dash air
do i love these folks? yes!
this is our second experience with e
these guys are the worst
"was told they were all ok and ""safe"" for travel"
again was told not to worry
they do not  know what they are  talking about
i am thrilled with the service we received!
thank you!
our story: an old coach for sure
but the story begins in 2012
we needed new dash air
ok  we are  ready to travel? no
the forward roof ac quit
on the return into the valley the air quit
again it quit
the third visit i thought they had it
the alternator had been replaced by evrv
i took off again and still no turbo
we had time to travel
we went to tombstone  bisbee and benson
on the way back the dash air quit yet again
first i returned to cummins for the sensor line
now it gets scary
i had a new belt onboard
i also had an old belt there that was too long
the mechanic used the wrong belt
i thought the ac compressor had locked up
i cut the ac belt and it still squealed
now it really gets good
that was not the case
these guys had a plan
great news
if i could give them a zero i would
every repair was butchered
thus not allowing any air to blow in the coach
i said replace it as i trusted them
ultimately you are only as good as your mechanics
stay away!!!
co-owner jeremy got involved
after picking it up  i headed for sedona
and man it was a scorcher that day
i pulled over and coolant was leaking out
it was a 3 inch long hose that had blown
thank you
sincerely keith w
we needed new dash air
only 1 leak set us back but they made it right
i have a 1991 foretravel  5
very good experience
had some damage when a tire separated
both were repaired at minimal cost to me
could not   ask for any better service
the owner  dan  supervised the work
a young fellow  john  did most of the work
very professional
highly recommended
detail  if interested:  we own a 1999 foretravel
foretravels were complex  expensive coaches
we are  very grateful
highly  highly recommended
kevin  tony & stacy at east valley rv are the best
these guys do great work
it  a cute  small park with a lakeview
this park is perfect because of its location
it  often busy or full  so arrive early
the boat launch area works great for our kayaks
there  a little beach to play with the kids
good little campground for those with kids
large play area near a beach
i was happy with it
i would stay here again!
i chose doc  based on reviews
i cant recommend them highly enough
this shop is a joke
it takes them way to long to do simple car mods
i was going crazy trying to fix my truck
very helpful  with a great attitude
thank you very much for fixing my truck
bad ass shop
i honestly could not  be happier
thanks again to the doc and the whole crew!
will definitely come back
joe gave me both
crazy  right? haha! thank you joe!!!
i am  torn writing this review
he was very knowledgable and knew what i needed
we will totally rent from the again
ace rental car
friendly and helpful staff
again  totally different from their website
ended up renting from economy
avr keep up the good work!debbie
3 weeks and 3 visits later still no call
i have  called and left 2 messages and  nothing
what else can i do?
i am  booking from now on with hotwire
i had a reservation las vegas to lax
my rate was $36
00 for the day
i had to purchase a plane ticket for $233
karen!!! best customer service from karen ever
i really like this company
great experience
is the best
this is my first time renting from avr
i had to wait almost hour for a minivan
the rep who helped me was julius cabrera
he was very friendly and professional
thank you julius!!
maybe it was new  maybe not
at this point  mediocre experience
never again
customer service was great
the van i rented seated 9 to 11 people
the van they rented me and my friends was unsafe
the van needed brakes and shocks
i will never rent from them again
i recommend they upgrade their vans
marie was amazing
she went above and beyond to help
i would rent again
i had a easy time renting
van was practically new and in awesome shape
overall i was pleased with this company
it was good and hot the days we were there
the office is spartan
i had rented a minivan on a prepaid rental
driver license and credit card required
the normal questions: prepaid gas  insurance etc
very little pressure as i declined all the extras
the van i received was a minivan with 48000 miles
it was clean and had a few ding and dents
some confusion on returning the van
not so at avr
the van was great
went to california for a camping trip
06 to feel the tank up which is 2
31 per gallon
00 to fill up the tank
it was 3 something per gallon
if you staying in vegas just put you own gas
so my point is there charging to much on gas 2
31 prepaid is not the way to go
yes that  fine
they did nothing to try and help me out
it was a miracle that she was not injured
it then took hours to get the van fixed
they were combative at every step
i will never rent from them again
if i could rate this zero stars i would
the customer service is horrible
marie was a pleasure to work with
thank you for the great service
apparently a reservation means nothing
well then
see you never again
im still trying to get a response
ca not  wait rental from this amazing company
thank you  avr!
decided to risk the bad reviews and rent
our experience was great
julius cabnera  is a great car rental agent
will return in future
never again!!!
do not  get me wrong
that female employee with bleach blonde hair
- she  super nice
i like her
but i will never book with them again
but i will  continue to book with enterprise
because even though they are more expensive
they are true to price of a rental
this place advertise at $188
no where near what was advertised
i do not  like false advertising
she put me completely at ease
i would use them again
ask for erlinda!!!!!
we said we never heard such a thing
at this point we should have left but we did not
the air conditioner was not working properly
i needed a van for a group of people in las vegas
i booked over the phone and it was simple
then i walked across the street
my van was ready upon arrival
i am  looking forward to renting from them again
highly recommended!! mikayla was awesome!!!!
or it may just be the vegas heat
but i am  pretty sure they do not  have a or c
anyway  their customer service was okay
their customer service skills are 0
we were on the lot for3
scottsdale rv is a joke
customer service is a deplorable waste of time
only one person there to communicate
showed us one trailer  then was finished with us
i would rather drive to the factory in indiana!
i guess my rv purchase was not important to them
but we did get it
thanks guys!
to bad such nice guys
i truly feel like these guy genuinely care
which is amazing now day
hence double pane windows
avoid this place
we are still waiting on some due items
it  been almost a year
bottom line: have an rv? give these guys a try
this is why service makes all the difference
called and asked and were given answers
checked camper inside and out and decided to buy
arrived around 11:00 and trailer was not ready
with chris' help  he finally made it work
bad experience is an understatement
i have a different view
complete lack of communication
i was the one who called back
the chassis light dimmer was broke
i could go on but you get the idea
we also service the generator and engine
"""this is the part that really bothers me"
that should have been my sign to stay away
great service  super nice staff
i would definitely return in the future
thanks jeff
we would not recommend it
these people really know what they are doing
all sorts of problems
everything was fixed perfectly
their attention to detail far surpassed my own
really impressed and i will  be back for sure
are they perfect?  no
thank you anna marie and crew!
steer clear!!!
these guys are better than many
anna-marie keeps that place going strong
ana is a dishonest business women
i ordered custom sheepskin seat covers
i will never do business with them again
"the leather on my mini cooper ""sidewalk"" split"
i thought i could fix it myself  but yeah
i took it to palacios
worth the $125 and the 1 hour trip
i will  be back with my patio furniture cushions
took my 1964 gto conv
in for a new top
palacios refused to stand by their work
do not trust them with your car!
i was told it would be $400
00 and would need to pay $70
00 to order the material
no big deal
i ordered the material and waited a week
overall  it was a $65
00 life lesson
super people
the price was fair and the work was beautiful
we found palacios on yelp
anna at palacios was a delight to work with
they took about 3-3
that said  the car now looks like new
seriously  it looked like new
he was very professional and flexible
i thought the initial price was fair
i am  so glad to have a clean car again
his attitude was the worst
i would recommend taking your business elsewhere
they did a great job   had a groupon
""" unacceptable"
would certainly use the service provided again
a big thanks to scott
efficient service and very convenient
tony chapma
good service  good job
he was virtuous and got right to work
not cheap by any means - but great service
they were easy to work with and very responsive
thank you mobile mechanics
sometimes you have to play hard ball with people
what a way to run a business!  sheesh!!!
brandon was able and knowledgeable
i would recommend
responded within two hours as promised
this was the only one that could make it
brandon was here in less than a half hour
had me up and running in no time
very polite and knowledgeable
we were finally able to change out our flat tire
imaging the frustation
joe was very friendly and professional
the mechanic was rude and intimating
stay away from this place
all they want to do is rip you off
i called this place on 5 or 28
no one showed
that was at 430 this afternoon
it is 8pm and i get a text saying another 1
they are thieves an liars
the office is rude and disrespectful
and they use profanity for customer service
i am very pleased
2 miles down the road  truck broke down
we seriously considered calling the police
then he released our truck
do not take your vehicle there!! beware!
our repairman was larry
he was wonderful  very experienced
jan 17  2016
thanks again larry we truly appreciate it
deb & lamar perris ca
riverside county
wasted $300 trying to fix a misfire in my engine
just a fair warning
so mobile mechanics of las vegas
ask for lee good mechanic
i would  give you
great guys to work with
thanks again scott!!
we have lived at cotton lane rv park for 13 years
we all have gone thru many changes in the park
this rv park sucks big ones
wifi is available if you pay for it
laundry room is clean
swimming pool is heated
not too friendly of a place
we wo not  stay here again
for the most part  this is a decent park
also  apparently they even close them at night
we could not  be happier with it
you guys were awesome and fun to deal with
thank you so very much!!
thank you jerry & sons!
the cars  ranged i supposed
a couple nice cars but most seemed kinda beat
the dealership looked old and tired
best used car purchase ever
i shopped for a long time and these were the guys
the slide-out stopped working
batteries need to be replaced
water heater still is not  fixed
thor is unresponsive
we first booked in 2004 and came back frequently
very professional
highly recommend!
they come and tell you they will get the part
great customer service
steer clear of them
do not  waste your money with their company
thanks again jeff and robin zientek
we rented from rv rental outlet two years in a row
shauna has been fantastic to work with
as is their pricing
we have  already booked for again next summer
i rented the 29 foot coachmen
i think our actual use came out to about 0
50 gal of gas per hour of generator use
boy are we glad we came here! david was wonderful
he helped explain everything to us
the whole process went very smoothly
we were in and out quickly
super easy and smooth
the gift was a success
these guys made it so easy
total newbies
especially kam  lance  and roger
a great company
ca not  wait for our next trip
this is a great place to rent from
the staff is very friendly and helpful
thanks gabe
they all know their stuff
worked great
the m20 trailer was great for 2 adults and 2 kids
they loved the bunk beds
thanks for letting us travel without any worry
rented rpod and everything was great
lance and the staff at rv outlet were amazing
booking a rental from out of state is risky
not being able to see the unit ahead of time
great experiance
would definitely recommend them
first he argued with me about the ac
it was now with the bank
still nothing
awful all the way around
at least pretend that you care
we were even invited to their thanksgiving turkey
the pickup and drop off were very easy
cameron was the sales person who helped us
he was very helpful
thanks again
we will  use you next time for sure
that way i know exactly what i am buying!!!
renting an rv from new york was a breeze
lance was super helpful through the whole process
i highly recommend this place and their rv
we will definitely rent from them again!!
great price and truly excellent service
we will be back!
the trailer looked really nice online
we would definitely use rv rental outlet again
lance & cam are a-ok in my book
we look forward to working with lanch again
i will definitely use them in the future
great experience all around
the whole rental process is smooth and efficient
i have worked with lance multiple times
great service
very accommodating with our needs
kam exceeded my expectations
highly recommend them for trailer rentals
the team at the rv outlet was great
best rv rental business in town
thank you so much
we will only use rv rental outlet in the future
i just got back from a long weekend trip
i rented the r pod trailer and it was really good
lance is an absolute pro
hat  off  great job
easy check in check out and the rv was great
thank you rob
we finally settled on rv rental outlet in mesa
the pick up process was a little lengthly
but this is not  just a car you are renting
return was smooth and friendly
we will be back to rent again for sure!
keep up the great work!
this would have  proved costly
it was just a 2 amp blown fuse
many thanks to desert mobile rv repair
our second time using their service
all done in our spot at oasis rv resort
reliable  trustworthy and skillful
we recommend them
so glad to have found mark
had my cooling unit go out on my rv
mike & mark were awesome
great service and great guys
we needed a faucet replaced in our rv
i highly recommend bob moses ceramic coating!!!
they did a great job and were very professional
scratches  swirl marks  and water marks
i only wash my truck now by hand
no scratches  swirl marks  or water marks
i have not  needed to wash it yet
i give them 5 stars
their customer service is also top notch
great group of guys there
thank you bob and crew
it  worth it
you truly get what you pay for
you want it done right  give bob a call
highly recommend
awesome jobs and customer service was epic
much appreciated
to bring that shine back
looks fresh and has reflection for days
i was losing the battle
and started doing some research
look carefully at the before and after shots
i was expecting good results
i got absolutely outstanding results
they look great and the awning motor covers
amazing staff
nothing but the best
look  i order parts all day long
i feel spoiled  they give me all of that
thanks  brooke from mattorro
chad did an amazing job
i ca not  even tell were they were
he showed up on time and he did a fabulous job
so convenient
the job he did is fabulous
beautiful job on my audi
that car also looks great
i highly recommend touch up pro
that would be an additional 5-7k on price quote
good luck! btw ernie
shame on you!!!!! remember karma!
you guys are the best!
thanks guys!
i wo not  go to anyone else
- mindy & scott with morning kick
absolutely horrible service
horrible experience
"they say ""we will  fix anything related to rv """
hats off to giant eagle repair and kathy brandt
the most convenient service i have ever had
apparently  we did not winterize well enough
thank goodness for double eagle
the rears were still fine
he said we would be back on the road about 3:00pm
just the parts and labor as quoted
i found them to be honest and personable
my experience was 5 star all the way
they people are great and very friendly
i will be back
this was my first time and these guys were great
an affordable honest mechanic that comes to you
i paid  he left and my car is much better
thanks for the service!
much gratitude to you guys
5 star service with 5 star customer service
i had a great experience with these guys
super professional from beginning to end
the mobile aspect is ridiculously convenient
called the number  rings twice and call ends
no voicemail or answer
tried several times for several days
thank you again mobile repair doctor!
our experience with mobile car dr was a relief
unlike the others  arv is completely custom
and you do not  just leave a message
everything is first rate
dirk & amy
no cable tv but good antenna reception
nice campground - pristine bathrooms
that concern was quickly quashed
we arrived early by miss timing on our part
the campsites were clean and well groomed
when we tent camped we developed this need
clean bathrooms
now that we rv it we require the same
this koa was well above standards
very very clean
the bathrooms had
that  a great touch
this spot deserves every award koa would give out
will not recommend to my friends and family
the arms and canopy need to be replaced
why  i do not  know other than he said no
in my case i guess that does not  apply
actually i said that was real professional
i think i will  just hang up
they just lost customer and thousands of dollars
how aweful! avoid at all costs! drive to mesa!
i have yet to have a bad experience
you can only feel sorry for them
this is not a campground
staff is friendly
security was patrolling on a regular basis
the pool is huge and warm
there is a large hot tub
there is a great gym and a smaller hot tub
there  lawn bowling and tennis courts
a tranquil pond with koi and a small for bridge
which i am  kinda partial to
i have lived in this park for a couple of years
they turn off the whole park
park is old outdated
it is like a little city
they have parties  and get to gathers weekly
you can be left alone
this is the place to be!!!!
needed a diagnosis on my dodge ram
rear differential problems
no charge for any of it
thumbs up to h & s auto
our poor little saturn has seen better days
the starter is an on going escapade for us
and probably will continue to be one
our starter shit the bed
glad we did
these guys were nice and straight forward
its hard finding decent mechanics
terry & diane brown
we took it in on 12 or 19 appt
we added a wash & wax detail @ agreed on price
check out these guys if you are  in the market
well guess what? it  probably his attitude
he did not  even walk in the coach with us
he just stood outside
both my husband and i work in public safety
we will be spreading the word!!
no pressure and informative sales persons
will definitely return for further purchases
i cannot say that about their neighbor cw
honest to boot!
beware of purchasing a unit from this dealer
this place was a high pressure sales tactic
as assumed  they did not call
he offered us
the list price
no other rebates or discounts
thank you so much everyone
ill write more post next service! 12 or 20
i have  had my rv serviced here 3 times
worst service ever
we took it to rp in may everything went fine
total of 8 hours drive time
one of the tires was wrapped around the axle
had to get a recovery tow truck $700
arrived at the tire shop at 10 pm that night
had to spend the night at a hotel
purchased new tires  rims and caps
better yet do not  buy from them
i had to give one star so this would post
we just purchased our travel trailer from them
we agreed on price and terms and interest rate
empty promises
will not do that again
consigned our toy hauler in april to them
"the ""hype"" was it would be sold very soon"
the contract was valid until end of july
i get this crazy idea to buy an rv
"""let  do it""  i said"
back to the sales office we went
well  it did not
i was totally impressed by the way i was treated
thanks again guys !! see you in a year !!
now we own a motorhome that needs a new engine
kip thank you for your time
so when it did go out it kicked a rod
now i own a rv that ca not  be used
the service dept needs a class on customer service
i will never go back there
i had warranty work done on my furnace
"wrong answer !! you are a ""service center"""
it would have taken 2 minutes to check it
i walked in and told them
the main piece was still upside down
i walked back inside and showed them
they put it on wrong
no apologies at all
one was roof vent covers to keep rain out
the other was a window awning
i drive a class a diesel
very professional and friendly service center
so apparently  they had to rush the oil change
the wash was part of the deal
experience with this company has been infuriating
we did not  have to do a thing
our service required three days
they also had propane at only $1
99 a gallon
lew & ramona c
pelham  new hampshire
the people
i have trusted them for years
the service department is terrible
and make you do all the work for warranty  etc
i have  heard you should go to vans
the con you must be good at finding problems
bring an expert if possible
after we took delivery  the goo came right back
very bad
minor details  but again  caveat emptor
our salesman dave roy was a pleasure to work with
he was knowledgeable and took his time with us
in the end we purchased a montana high country
no high pressure
the entire staff has been very helpful
we felt like they low balled us on the trade
do your research first
he was very pleasant to work with
we bought a nice used trailer with his help
the price was right in our price range
we went in on memorial day

extremely bad service department

they helped get the warranty  work approved
highly recommend
each time i call i get a different story
very disappointed in the service at orangewood
to add to the story
these guys are the worst
the service is non existent
so good luck
i am still in shock
overall i am very disappointed in this business
surprise police department report #170204895
called for appointment spoke to a service advisor
upon arrival  no reservation was found
we came to orangewood rv to service four items
it took 15 days to complete the work
customers waited for hours with few or no updates
it created frustration
here is our list
technician had to redo the installation
no quality control
ac cover plate screws were now too loose
mentioned this to the service advisor
no quality control
incorrect front roof vent installed in the salon
did not want to wait on orangewood rv any more
no quality control
no quality control
coach received a courtesy wash
no quality control
no quality control
no quality control
customer washed the floor and vacuumed the carpet
again  we did not want to wait on orangewood rv
no quality control
no quality control
three months have passed since our first call
as far as we know they have done nothing
lew & ramonacrestview  florida
so apparently they had to rush the oil change
the wash was part of the deal
still   there is no substitution for supervision
we had brought in just the fire and rim
i did not  check it
it was a 5 bolt pattern rim
good thing i have the old rim
i am  pissed
my trip is delayed
i have to go back to correct this
they are not close
they were recommended to us by bell road rv
not a happy camper
of course they could
yesterday we had 6 tires replaced on our motorhome
these guys were great
they know there stuff and were very informative
yesterday we had 6 tires replaced on our motorhome
they charged me 75 bucks
i will never go there again
completely ripped off by that place
everyone was professional and kind
will use again and recommend
tom at the front desk was great
fairly friendly service
first impression
helpful  friendly and warm
i travel all over the u
for my trade

met the onsite managers
rare for an rv resort
awesome pool and hot tub
clean and very nice laundry room
pool table
security and gate

terrible rv resort
some very strange characters living there
not a safe park to be in
"""resort"" is no longer"
grounds are worn and pool is in disrepair
spa and pool should not even be used
very strange!!!! used to be a nice resort
beautiful park
nice swimming pool or hot tub
great spots with pull-throughs
staff was friendly and accommodating
and more
i went ahead made a reservations online
how dumb is that
good amenities and pool
besides the fact i would stay here again
a one star for us  wifi and cable non-existent
not recommended rental place
too much hassle and headache to rent a van
100% guaranteed satisfied with the car we rented
gave us good and very fast service
she  very proffesional and friendly
i will definitely rent again at this location
richard was very helpful
it was fast and easy
thank you so much! -wally

office has an open lights on but no one inside
worse customer service!!!
unexplainable amount of hidden fees
never using this service again
other than that  thumbs down
but  i will  say more
avr price
love the flexibility at this place
we have had nothing but great service with avr
sometimes even on a moments notice
we received a great price and great new van
we will definitely be back
shopped around and they had the best rate
requested a newer model and they accommodated
avr customer service was amazing
everyone i spoke with was polite and helpful
cheap price for rent a van
and very good  service
i rent a van for grand canyon with my friends
cristian help us a lot ! 6 or 14-16 3 days
my name is peijie
5 stars for the price
when i came to the avr car  k
maire help me a lot
hope next time will come again to let her help me
my experience was pretty good
2014 van available when i arrived
it was properly cleaned and fuel
rate was awesome
if i pay afterwards  that fee would be 29 cents
an extra driver is $9 per day per extra driver
we had a great time
the van worked fine  a or c was great
and everyone had a great time in death valley
one of the worse experiences with enterprise ever
yes hockey
they will give you the same exact car they say
ummmm ever enterprise out here is out of cars
off to the airport location we go
will never ever rent from this crappy place again
vans are below standard
old & dirty
customer service is horrible! long wait
first & last time renting here
i got there and i had a lot of help
one of the employees cristian helped me
he was really helpful  and very polite
avr is a great place for renting vans
i wo not  be renting from them again
i rented a van on line for a family vacation
i had a great experience
picked it up and only took about 10 minutes
everyone was fantastic
super nice and friendly
i would use them again
thanks guys
rented mini van for a month
pick up and drop off were seamless
staff was great
very accommodating
van was  in good shape
rate was half of other rental companies
my experience was great
no hidden charges
very pleased
first rent a car service and everything went well
thanks for your permission  manager!!
i would not  recommend this place to anyone
we needed a mini van for a trip to ca
avr had the best rate
marie helped us out with our reservation
she was very helpful and friendly
she even threw in wifi for free
if i could rate this zero stars i would
the customer service is horrible
again  all talk and no action  no follow through
good service
not!! they are horrible
i wish i could give zero star
experience left bad taste!!!
will not use them again
thanks to marie and also
few time a year  my church rents a van from avr
their price is very reasonable
grace welcomed us with great smile
usually they just showed a van and gave me a key
thanks grace!
far from deal breakers though
thanks ace!
i had a great experience with avr
i would certainly rent from them again
i will be using them again !
where do i start
really how is it not ready
they were also really slow
oh great we thought
avr has the best price
it was such a great experience
when i dropped off the van socorro was so helpful
i would definitely rent from avr again
so we contacted them on how to get it back
thank you for making my birthday special
go try avr in las vegas
not very happy with this company
got that part figured out
it  been 5 days since we returned the vehicle
never renting from here again
big mistake
the van we rented was a 2017 dodge grand caravan
the van itself had no issues  but it was dirty
this was tuesday night
never renting from here again
this whole situation was a waste of time
we had a pleasant experience with avr
julius was very friendly and helpful
five stars services! thank you julius!
my issues was with the vans
the first van i got the ac was broke and beat up
rented a van through avr using expedia
way to clean! never again
while we were there march 18th
another customer was having the same issue
so obviously this is their m
to make more money
worst camping world ever
do not buy from them
they do not  stand behind their products
now we have to work to get our claim paid
they sold us a lemon
i would never buy from them again
we would highly recommend them
thanks camping world  lowell and cindy young
most of them smelled musty & like animal urine
very nasty
got a great deal on a rialta
i told him it looked like it could use new tires
and do you adjusted the price accordingly
new management very friendly and helpful
i went through hell with this place
the absolute worst communication ever
they are clueless at best
i feel for the staff
you have  been warned
they do not  know you any more
i am  not entirely sure how they do it
they also gave me a great price on my trade in
we needed our aquahot system repaired
we needed our ac fixed
i would estimate they had $300 in parts total
i am done dealing with scottsdale rv
i bought a coachmen orion 20cb in august 2017
i called on 7 or 30 and left a voice mail
no response
i called on 7 or 31 and spoke to mercedes
again  no response
it is now 8 or 2 and i still have not heard back
this is not the first time this has happened
it  not really an efficient place
when i ask about it  i get no answer
i still have not  gotten my title to register it
i am not sure what takes this long
i was dealing with noah and chris
they went above and beyond trying to please me
then george answered all my technical questions
thank you guys!
we did so
so at that point we no longer had a rv to use
he did not answer the phone so we left a message
we are now 3 weeks past promised delivery
at this point  we left
buyer beware of this dealership
i bought a toy hauler from this place i love it
pricing was excellent service was great
i went there today to pick up my rv
this place is moving to chandler
good luck
i felt for the customer today
i complained and was told by noah
chris is wasting his talent at this place
could only be internal
gates are locked and keyed
the worst experience in a business ever
an absolute nightmare
god help them
we bought a used rv there almost 2 months ago
the salesman did not  know crap about the rv
their choice
we got a bill for his time for almost $300
i had the filter with me so they changed it
they had to go get the transmission filters
so i called back and they rushed someone to add 1
5 gallons of fluid
called in and talked to the manager and the owner
we would not recommend it
otd good to see people still care
they were not pushy and answered all my questions
i ended up purchasing 5 new tires
kyle was great to work with in the sales dept
very impressive business!
i know why this place has 5 stars
i would  give it more if i could
we were helped by a very smart service man
i wish we would  gotten his name
great customer service ! they are creative
thanks anne marie and wade
service department great
also had it washed and it looked great
very professional and friendly
will be using them for all our rv service needs
no one else did that
we are from out of state & live in our rv
they were all genuinely kind & caring
thank you!
we first tried working with camping world
what a mistake
thank you so much once more
r&r monaco
"this is their ""large current inventory"""
i have  read horror stories on line
there was no charge
i could not  be happier!
wade was a very knowledgeable salesman
wade educated us on rvs during the process
we will happily take our rv for service here
anna marie was very nice
a great place at reasonable prices
had 2 different projects completed here
i bought the foam  they did the upholstery
they look fantastic
friendly staff  super thorough
highly recommended!
nearly two years later and the other seat split
no need to look elsewhere
thanks jesse!
great place! they have redone several of my boats
awesome work  super price
highly recommend
i had a chair redone here
they were so nice and knowledgeable
i will be having more done soon
i had hardwood floors installed in my rv
could not have been happier with the results
great family business
family owned-business
highly recommended
this company is fantastic
i had a small tear in an outdoor cushion
i took it in  expecting to have to leave it
the quality of work is superior
the staff is friendly  helpful  and professional
the work looks brand new
"even my wife said to me  ""wow honey"
it looks really nice
"""  i would definitely recommend palacio"
i took my car there to get a small hole repaired
i asked them three times not to make it worse
when i saw the repair it was terrible
then they ripped me off for 70
this place sucks i would never recommend it
what a great business owner
professional and ethical
i would highly recommend palacios upholstery
$150 well spent
the first time   he apologised and re-scheduled
not the way to run a company
needless to say  it was a hot mess
i will  be back!
they come to you  kind and courteous
very knowledgeable
never ever will go to another place again
oh and scott is the best ever!!!
i called about a dead battery that needed a jump
i went back into my house
he showed up late in the afternoon  spent 1
for 125$ starter they charged me 389$
never call them
i did not  like it at allllllll
blake was fast  thorough and great to deal with
these folks seem pretty available
i highly recommend keith and mobile mechanics
i am  a satisfied customer
so we had the replaced it
we found out that the abs is now shot
these guys are great
our classic chevy van would not start
mobile mechanics of las vegas
thanks kevinscott harris
what luck! and kevin was super nice
i know there are negative reviews here
and we are  on our way home
thank you patrick!
my used rv needed new air bags for the suspension
setup the appointment and was quoted a price
this was at 9pm
could not  be more pleased
if i could rate them -1 i would
i would give them negative stars if i could
this place refused to honor their guarantee
cslled me a f##king b###h and hung up on me
i file a complaint with the bbb
he already had 8 complaints  4 in the last year
avoid at all costs
we went to o are illy auto parts and got one
we called in and ordered service
they were very prompt and called us right back
the technician was there in less than an hour
i definitely recommend this company
thanks scott!
i was so impressed with the service i received
i will use their services again
keep up the great work
if it was possible for me to give no stars i would
i called to have on site battery replacement
not 24 or 7
we needed a belt change and fuel filter
told them we were in a hurry
they were deceitful about timing spain 1-1
we since discovered this is their business model
i just worked with larry
i would use this service again
this was such a bummer of an experience
anyways  i did call
i called 5 times and texted
i waited 2 hours  called again  no answer
another hour  called again  no answer
another hour someone shows up
i told him what to do and had to help him
so we got the belt on
not a good experience
the owner is a bullshitter and a liar
stay away!!!!! wicked douchebag!!!!
we were satisfied with the service
we had called others who were a no show
good job!
horrible !
still no call back as of today
he was very polite and quick
very professional company
easy to deal with and he did an awesome job!
this company is horrible do not use them
aaa did not  have the starter battery available
the mechanic was awesome
he felt so bad for us and was incredibly human
will recommend them to anyone!
wow was that a huge mistake
they said they would pick up the car in an hour
i looked at him and smiled and said thank you
patrick is wonderful
it probably cost more
i would not suggest this company
this is far from my favorite rv park
thank you for all! good rv  gentle staff
great time
i hope to rent another time
hi from italy
we trust her with our coach!
incredibly unprofessional in every aspect
stay away from these guys and look elsewhere!
avoid at all costs
the trailer was fantastic
in fact  they exceeded our expectations
we are now trailer campers

jamey was very helpful
they made sure we had every thing we needed
we will definitely be repeat customers!
a++++ and 5 star service
thank you lance!ryan + family
we have rented twice now from rv rental outlet
would never rent from them again
generator went out after 2 hours
i finally figured out it was the breaker
we could not  use the toilet after that
so the water tank was always empty
basically  the whole weekend was a big disaster
when i returned the rv
oh yes  while i was waiting for my big $75 refund
big safety issue!
the unit was clean and performed well
"a special ""thank you"" to lance"
highly recommended
the rv was in great condition
go here first
you wont be disappointed
great customer service
great customer service
really organized
felt like it was my own vehicle
we trust them and will continue to rent from them
lance did an awesome job for us
second time i have rented from this business
hi this rv  rental is the best in arizona
thanks lance
lance  and the personnel are excellent
and i left the anti theft lock key at the house
check in and check out was a breeze
lance had everything set up with the paperwork
they even fixed my trailering light connection
and here is the amazing part
he provided a+ service
they could not  have been more accommodating
a thumbs up for rv rental outlet
and of course tax
their rates were also very competitive
these guys are outstanding
the service and quality of the rvs is top notch
highly recommended and will use them again
super friendly and helpful team

he was awesome
super friendly service
do not rent from this company
rented an rv for 16 nights
day one  took 3 hours to get the coach
sat for 4 hours waiting for a repairman
this was due to fuel shorting out the ecm
again could have been prevented
we sat 4 1 or 2 hours
they also did not have time to clean it
replacing tires $1500
bought rv back and spoke to owner mike ciardullo
after all it is summer and they are busy
mike thought that was excessive and offered $1000
would not  want to put him in a bind financially
his response was
sorry for stepping on toes
the rv  are not well maintained
great customer service
highly recommended
i will definitely use them for all future needs
thanks guys!!!

i highly recommend prime design
thank you !!!
worst buying experience of my life
no kidding around
registration and tags took a month
arizona native 46 years
they are always curtious and polite
i would highly recommend double eagle rv
had a couple of issues with jacks and stairs
i was so insulted  that has changed
i run my business out of my rv
never use them
thank you  thank you
you guys rock!
went past the original agreement
i was quoted $523
when i came to pick it up the bill was $748
i showed them the written quote of $523
but he did not honor that
i picked it up that night
i did not  see the damage until the next morning
i will never take it to them again
look elseware
our experience was excellent with these folks
they charged us $154
00 and did not  fix anything
they caused more problems and fixed nothing
no one had even looked at it
do not  waste your time
john saved me over $1 000
thanks john for your help you rock!!!dee
cost me over $800
six months after that it began  overheating again
i am  so happy i called
i am blessed
two hours later  the truck is back in business
lovely!  i drive a 2006 dodge ram 2500 4x4 5
9l cummins diesel
when i asked which dealer  he did not  know
they work all across the valley and come to you
may you live long and prosper!
mobile car doctor far exceeded my expectations
i found mobile car doctor  and am so glad i did
these guys were great
they have my phone number
why not just call?
makes no sense to me
my car runs beautifully again
scott did a great job and was very honest
normal day getting ready for work and boom
wife  car would not  start
he came in about 2hrs and changed the battery
it turned out to be a bad alternator as well
thanks again!!
i have been using mobile car dr
scott is the best
i contacted mobile car dr
the cost of a pre-purchase inspection is $120
that includes no photos and no written report
after a long list   before he called me
i guess i know why he overlooked so many things
scott also did not  mention this to me
i guess the doctor just needed beer money
attention to detail  that  what it  all about
i am  throughly impressed
my interests were protected at all times
dave & carolbb2
sites are wide  easy access and nicely mowed
bathrooms were very clean & organized well
but that is what happens with easy access
showers and laundry are nice
the staff is very helpful and took us to our site
easy to find off the highway
my windows 7 laptop could use the wifi access
great koa- easy in and out for big rigs
well tended  nice little pool
ok for 1 night stay
already read reviews about highway noise
couple running it were very friendly
no shade trees & grass needed mowing
biggest peeve is grass not kept
sufficient for a nights stay
they did not fix or replace it just nasty people
friendly  professional and yet great personality
lol  you get the straight up with this group
they will get our business every time
a lot of knowledge in once place
this review is a long time over due
al  rv saved the day
love this place in glendale
stay away if you value your time and your money
this is a very friendly  active park
many amenities
suits us to a t!
it screams bacteria
due to family issues we cannot take the trip
we were charged $25
cancelation fee
do not book here if you have a smaller trailer
unacceptable business practice
many older people are afraid to speak up
thank you john for always taking care of me
anyone else would have just charged me $2k
i am sure glad i found john and staff at h & s
john is a stand up mechanic and business owner
i would recommend his shop and services any day
offer to shuttle me to work at his expense
i bought a used class c from dap rv
it was a class act from start to finish
i noticed quite a huge selection as well
i had the best experience at desert autoplex
everyone was very helpful and welcoming
i highly recommend them for all of your rv needs
if we could give negative stars  we would
this place is just the opposite
now  the real review
the lack of service department
we contacted the department   reputable
this has been a pathetic experience
do not  know if tucson is any better
ca not  be any worse
or can it?
nice thing to say to a veteran
incredible buying experience from the beginning
could not  be happier with our new fifth wheel
the whole process was simple and smooth
highly recommend
great place to buy a vehicle
in addition they were overpriced
it was just as described and pictured online
no picture cropping or misinformation
thanks again desert autoplex
if i could leave no stars i would
class act team of professionals
if i could rate this a zero  i would
i took my 2015 ventana there for service
we were looking and not buying
if his intention was to have us leave it worked
we left and will never go back
newmar recommended this dealer for warranty work
our first experience was great customer service
this leads to a high level of frustration
great customer service
they like to blame time and parts on factory
also blamed on factory
we paid in full with a trade in of our 5th wheel
it is pretty much useless
it would not  unlock so sat with wet clothes
fat chance
my part arrived hours late
no reimbursement
they were fair and honest with me and my wife
ask for brian knox!
there are many shortcomings  i
again a very thorough process
thanks  brian!
it was worth the drive from so cal
beware of this place
they low ball the hell out of you on the trade in
i would not do business with this company
he obviously loves what he does
you guys are first class!rich & raylene
low retail for my boat is 39 000
they just offered me 17
they definitely were polite and helpful
was a fairly pain-free process
they have great customer service and great prices
do not  waste your time going anywhere else
everyone was courteous  friendly and helpful
i would definitely do business with them again
this company does not deserve any stars
they are the typical used car salesmen
they flat out lied to me on several occasions
i got it home to find out it had a broken frame
they said the repacked the wheel bearings
there was a problem with the title as well
i was a fool to trust them  do not  you be one
nancy and brian were great salespeople
the delivery man  shawn was awesome
this entire experience was absolutely wonderful
very satisfied with rv az selling my rig for me
with much gratitude  rawley mcc
i am very  satisfied with rvarizona
thanks for the great experience
update to follow
these people were awesome
anything we needed got done right away
what else could anyone want
tony was very kind with us and patient
took my rv back to orangewood rv on nov
he was knowledgable and not pushy
everyone who worked with us was wonderful
"1 or 2"" high it looks sloppy"
took my rv back to orangewood rv on nov
so sorry we towed our trade-in all the way there
we wo not  be back!
i purchased a r
well  it took 4 months which is not my complaint
the communication with customers is non-existent
sure made it hard to believe anything they said
lots of excuses but no responsibility
had several issues after the first outing
they had it for over 4 months
still not fixed
thank you all for exceptional service!
"1 or 2"" high it looks sloppy"
i called numerous times to be ignored
purchased our grand design in idaho
shane scott was a delight to work with
thanks shane!
00 dollar to check air pressure
really !  after haven them do 250
then orangewood entered our shopping
tony b  shane  mark  couldent be happier
lots of knowledge and very customer friendly
kyle and efran were extremely helpful
cant say enough about them or this place
these guys know how to treat customers
this place is on their game and reasonably priced
i definitely recommend this place
their staff is what makes the difference
paul and the guys will do an outstanding job
anything from rv  to rigs to cars and trucks
always prompt  friendly and top quality work
just bought a set of tires for my monaco rv
they did a great job installing the tires
highly recommend firebird tire
finally  we found firebird tire on line
destiny was the answer
see yall soon!
for that this was fine
also  close to the i-10  really convenient
great stop
hot hot hot! no shade to be found and no grass
just aisle after aisle of rock
very clean and felt secure
my dogs enjoyed the fenced dog run
do your self a favor; do not stay here
this rv resort is a trailer park full of drama
do not stay here the management is terrible
they are pet friendly
sites are small with minimal privacy
the location is good
goodyear is close to phoenix  scottsdale etc
the park is extremely clean and well maintained
we have been coming here for more than a decade
so beware
i have been a customer since 2000
service is first rate and exceeds expectations
at south east
do not  trust him
he literally texted us over 100 times
desperate for money=bad judgment and workmanship
he missed the most important part of the job
not covered
he is the worse
so he said he would be there at noon
finally he shows up at 4pm
working alone it took him about 4 hours
i give this a 4
he repaired our car at a budget friendly price
he was well worth the money
he was courteous and knows what he is doing
i would recommend allard for your next repair
i will be calling on his service again
i paid him to do 2 jobs
a head gasket and a cv joint and bearing
just a text and a email then he blocked me
he still did not  do the 2nd job
looking at it he did not install it fully
now there was coolant shot all over the place
i lost too much to let it lie
i hired this guy to do a diag on my 93 chevy 4x4
i was not getting fuel to the injectors
the truck still would not run

we highly suggest staying here
i never received a response or call-back from him
even the drop off was veryyyyyy easy and quick
thanks guys for making our trip so awesome
best regards mark and nancy k
where do i start
my customers experience has been the worst
patrick was my sale person and is the worest
worst dealer ship experience i have ever had
so they agree to proceed ahead
i feel like they are avoiding us
i just want this to end
approved or denied  i just want this to be over!
moved 32 blocks west  and changed their name
please go somewhere else
after paperwork is done they miss treat you
i guess since paperwork done it was bye felicia
and that i would not receive my down payment back
if i could give this place a zero i would
he left after he swiped our card for $1500
"00 and a couple minutes later ""left"""
avoid this place at all costs!
0000000000000000 star i would have!
i did end up getting my escape
i even got a free 3 month  warranty
so i am happy overall
a one is giving this place tooo much credit
lies lies lies
this was my 3rd visit to state trailer
i was totally satisfied and will use them again
thanks josh!
thank you justin for help me identify the issue
most likely you save me a bunch of money
clean restrooms next to it are always nice
recommend checking them out if you are  in peoria
it  located off of peoria ave
i find generally everything i need here
propane was a good deal
customer service is great
staff is very customer friendly
the dump station is truly free
i then needed some work done on my new trailer
they also recommended some new springs
i schedule the work a few week later
they took about a week to complete the work
i never knew there was so many things for a rv!
did a muffler delete here with my gti
easy 5 stars
i wanted a new exhaust for my car
they were quick to respond
car sounds great
definitely recommend performance muffler
thanks russ
needed a piece of tube bent for a project
ended up fitting perfect
found this company on yelp
they pulled my car onto lift and got to work
i will be a return customer thank you
i highly recommend pro muffler
quality work at a reasonable price
will bring the others as the need arises
thanks guys! see you in the new year
the shop is first come  first serve
they open on saturday 8am-12pm
i arrived at 7:30 and was second in line
i passed emissions no problem
prices are good  workmanship is great
i have  found my new muffler shop
when i arrived i spoke to lucas
never had any issues since
just want to add our 5 star review
we are more than happy with our car
we have even experienced better gas mileage
would recommend pro muffler to everyone
great service from marcus
took his time to make the exhaust fit perfect
would recommend anyone here!
james had us out the door for only $210
car passed emissions and runs perfectly
what more can you ask for?
so far i am happy with what i got
these guys are awesome
how  that for service
that right
5 stars for james
several hours of waiting
overall the welding work he does is excellent
manager is a monster
i called to inquire
"lady named izzy responded ""i did not  do it"""
she snapped! that  it
raise your voice to me
you have 72 hours to get your stuff out
this is your 72 hour eviction notice
the very next day they took another months rent
go az storage inns less than 2 miles away
horrible  horrible experience
and i was a 2 time customer here
this time 2 years
all this in front of another customer
the one star is for the rate
terrible experience with the management
failed to auto bill and threatened us
lost our rental records
never again
they are not reliable   lie
stay away from this dealer
they have a huge facility for sales and service
i could not  tell if i should ask for help or not
i would  go back for the service techs alone
they do great work
horrible experience indeed!!!!not pleased at all
horrible service
no service is rendered
rip off is rendered
i will never go back
i wish i could give them a zero score!!!!
they also tried to scrape it  big chunks missing
i wont be back
i would definitely take my vehicle there again
giving one star is all i can honestly give
plus my check was cashed weeks prior
next thing is to get my brake controller installed
nothing was checked
3 hours late to hit the road  we are  off
now  we are camping and the sink does not  drain
again  they did not  do their job
in every facet of this sale or purchase
nothing went right and so much went wrong
totally disappointed in ldlp!
we buy a lot of our motorhome parts here
drove 40 miles for absolutely nothing
these place is not  worthy of any stars
same ole run around
narrowed it down to 2 items to be fixed
called me twice in those several months
no communication
last review on 08 or 11 still dont have a window
if they havent lost the frame
trust the reviews below
they are true
i also went to look at trailers one time
do not select this dealership
every 2-3 uses they break
if i could select no stars on the review i would
everything going great  next stop finance
michelle was wonderful and very helpful
that is when we were taken to parts
told john is our point of contact
i will not be back
took a month to get minor things repaired
that was a poor decision
lesson learned
nobody likes to be ripped off
this burn will be remembered when we upgrade
share!!! please!!! listen up
went to little dealer little prices today
worst experience ever
we found a couple things of interest
they were very helpful
guess they depend on the uneducated consumer
the worst experience ever
this place is the worst for customer service
bought a new rv from them
i had to wait 3 weeks to get an appointment
it  hot here in september and no ac
i told them this when i made appointment
dropped trailer off on monday 8am
yes was my answer
i did not  hear anything monday or tuesday
he had trailer fixed next day
the salesman was pretty nice if a bit pushy
we left messages which were not  returned
add to that
this not a great dealership
we took our 5th wheel in for some warranty work
phillip was courteous  helpful and friendly
a joke of a dealership
i will  go elsewhere to find what i need
we purchased a new travel trailer in early spring
did not  think to test toilet
we had no running water
did not  know if the pipes were frozen or what
he said it smelled new when he walked in it
the cabinets are scratched and with chips
the trailer smelled  not new
3 times in 4 weeks the wrong window was ordered
he was outgoing and friendly
the hub caps fell off the day of purchase
another added expense
it is just my husband and i
we purchased this toy hauler in september 2012
within the service department
the service aspect equals multiple thumbs down
she always made herself available
it was a great experience from beginning to end
how are these people even still in business?
it was actually really neat to see
and it should not  be yours either
"well  is 6am and time for me to ""clock out"" too"
they lie lie lie   do not  go to them
long story  short result
one star is too many
never go here
took a class a coach in for slide repair
this was done after more than 3 weeks of prodding
they are not customer oriented
that was back in 2014
which 1 they could not fix
guess i should have learned the first time
will never deal with them again! june 19th 2015
terrible service
everyone that looks at this review thinks
"""well it  a dealership  nobody will leave happy"
this dealership is so unbelievably scandalous
the salesmen and everyone there are scam artists
these people are by far unprofessional
and had put a holding deposit on it
unbelievable! extremely unprofessional
do not trust this company
wow is all i have to say
im appalled
service department is messed up
smooth purchase and easy fun delivery
but most of all terrific service
at $120 or hr labor  feels like a rip off
you ca not  just talk to someone who can help you
not a phone call returned or email replied
i have used the ldlp for only parts and knowledge
michelle the parts girl is amazing
the jaycos are great trailers i am on my 2nd
hunh?  uh  no
this is about sales  parts  and service
understandable
monday comes and zane called me to pick it up
then  dropped of the trailer for work
here it is friday and they have not  touched it
i am no longer a fan
overall  a very terrible experience
and it continues
reasons to come here:1
) you are  hot2
) you are  bored3
hmmm  i will  just leave it at that!
totally reliable in every way!
may just want to have a salesperson follow you
judge for yourself
"""  cool  i said"
when i asked for them back
but i had to reinstall them
he did not  even offer
i went in to the store on deer valley today
danny and his team were very helpful
the sales world needs more people like him
it got stolen
seems like an inside job
mike the service manager did not  really care
no empathy at all
to whom ever is concerned
been 2 months
so much for standing behind your product
robertconnected home solutions
instead he says f u
i got someone else on this one
i am irate on this response
he responds by text no less
with the above and no  human contact
take advise
bullshit!
thanks to jose  scott and the service manager !
i said thank you for your time and hung up
we wo not  be returning
5 stars all the way for randy and the staff
the set up alone is worth a visit
all the best!  jd
they even dealt with the insurance company
would do business with them again anytime
no rating would be most appropriate
over a $230 oil change
jason corrected the situation
i will go back to them again
tell him buttercup sent ya
he will  remember my dog
there service department is an absolute joke
no ant piles! yay! good for pets
could not  get satellite  tree in the way
did not see a pool
would stay here again
the bathhouse is well situated and clean
i find it to be very quiet
everyone we have met has been very nice
i really like the place
our internet and cable are fitting our needs
i love it here
would recommend it to everyone who camps
highly recommend
no problems whatsoever
clean and well maintained grounds
the staff in the office is excellent
great location
ca not  think of anything negative to say
it  a little tight for pulling in with a big rig
the internet does not  work
my att service here is only 2 bars
there are 3 open spots the same size
this is not a place to stay for a couple of weeks
it is 95% full time
horrible  i will never return
my onan generator stopped working
the carb is no longer serviceable
i installed myself
i am  not a mechanic but i am pretty handy
took me about 30 minutes
i obviously did something wrong installing it
i thought
i bring the 5th wheel to them
they quoted 3
5 hours of labor
they will never get another dime from me
and 3 weeks wasted
awful  just awful
meanwhile we are stranded here
very  hard  to  get  anybody  on  the  phone
came in to get some work done
offered complimentary popcorn water and coffee
staff was friendly and help
we have come to venture out since we were kids
now on the third generation of owners
there are so many fun things to do
we love love love this park
we vote on projects and improvements
many amenities  well maintained
this park is not  cheap either
but we all know the end of that story
i called others  but non called me back
he fixed everything that needed to be done
i am thrilled
he also adjust my door for me
jeff was awesome
i had problems with two awnings
they just left me high and dry
he knows what he is doing
you will be sorry if you call anyone else
our rv was stored in canada for the past 3 years
in short  big mistake and very bad yelp reviews
my husband is very happy with fix-my-rv
fix my rv arrived on time
absolutely competent
the fix my rv is certified repairman
we will continue to use them
he also replaced our chassis batteries for us
his pricing is reasonable and fair
fix-my-rv is an outstanding service
he always calls back when he says he will
"he  the ""real deal"" for sure!!"
jeff showed up for the 2nd appointment on time
fix my rv did a great job on our older motorhome
great service!
we contacted jeff to replace our patio awning
he should have said this at our first meeting
do not  waste your time with him
go to someone who can actually get your job done
not a great example of customer service
i would  say
called jeff and he came the  next day
had a bad solenoid and he replaced it
very personable man and honest too
charged me a fair price for his work and parts
to start with  gas tank was 1 or 3 full
that was annoying  but minor
this is our departure story
' err  because we were told to? nevermind
last time i checked  you are a travel company
from there  it went from bad to worse
reserved a budget truck weeks in advance
or any other time  either
frustrating experience with poor customer service
placed a reservation for a budget truck online
they will not make something right or even try
i requested a truck on 7 or 12 for 7 or 16
i would be embarrassed to be affiliated with him
i drove there
due to this extremely unprofessional experience
i show up at the pick up time and  no truck
not just my truck  they had no trucks at all
when i showed up
as if moving is not stressful enough!
do not use this place
i should have read previous reviews first
he did not  care that he was losing business!!
worst customer service ever
this place completely ripped me off
i did not take my car until friday at 4 pm
this is an awful place
but i do not  blame the service people
i blame management
they did not  know the unit was in their lot
i did not  want my rv in their lot all this time
our camper had minor issues
they said they winterized it
we are supposed to be camping next weekend
i suggest no one else do the same
bought a pop up camper here
i did not  care to permanently park my rv there
i could be there in 10 minutes
that was not an option
you can see where they taped it up to get by
they also fixed the wiring problem
the temporary one expires tomorrow
we purchased a faulty rv from this business
if i could give zero stars i would
horrendous customer service
customer service is awful
avoid them at all cost!
wish i had the option of leaving 0 stars
worst experience i have had
they charged us $2000
always a voice message
we will do our future business elsewhere
bad service
"00 to do it as a ""service"" item"
i purchased a used rv from tom johnson in nov
00 repairing things as we found them broke
replaced the key lock on the front basement door
one very obviously from a very shoddy repair job
had to replace the entire landing gear
lesson learned
i then wanted to take a test drive
no one to help us again
i am female and my companion was female
i guess i should have done that first
i shopped all over the carolinas for my new camper
i shopped all over the carolinas for my new camper
avoid tom johnsons at all costs
they have  had my newmar coach for 7 weeks
well next week never comes
hopefully i will  have it back next week
very poorly run service department
i will  never go back
terrible service  they had our rv for 3 months
denied us warranty claims
just go somewhere else!
they knew we needed it this weekend
we told them to at least fix the water heater
i lubed again per their instructions  nothing
the customer service is terrible
we made an appointment with a sales rep named ron
camping world of concord is a great place
their selection of campers and rv  is amazing
the buses they have are mind blowing
highly recommend!!
well that did not  go well
but they wo not  communicate with us about it
this was the first week of july
calls and emails go unanswered  no communication
the corporate office was of no help either
read the reviews
i wish i had
really  really bad customer service
i would  give them zero stars if possible
love shopping at camping world
i had 3 different service reps assigned to me
does not even deserve 1 star
horrible customer service
absolutely the rudest sales experience
this place does not  even deserve 1 star
take your business somewhere else!
bottom line - buyer beware
i made an online cash offer on an older   rv
the msrp from 2008 is really irrelevant in 2016
ultimately  on a $199 000
"and he even said ""maybe"
professional?  no
motivated to work a deal?  no
"""respectful?""  no"
able to motivate to a buyer?  no
kathy towle
"""sure  come on out "" said paul the salesman"
pretty evident i was just wasting his time
no  i have  got other options
wo not  be back
nick and the boys were great
just had a great experience with nick & this shop
again the service was amazing
went back again and again
nothing! they charged me 394
00!!!  tried to get $2000
00 out of me
beware of this aamco!!!!
update to previous review
he says it  worse than ever
very upsetting
i do not  trust this car anymore
we have no loaner or replacement vehicle
the tech seemed to blame faulty nissan parts
i do not  know what to think
4 or 20 or 16 - car is still in the shop
no call or update from aamco
these guys are awesome
nick always tells it to me straight
i was in and out in just about 15 minutes
the manager even helped me himself
00 in repairs
i almost started crying
special thx to nick
total with  new filter  seals and  new fluid $425
do i need to say more ?
great service and honest mechanics
i definitely recommend you go here
btw price was more than reasonable
went back again and again
nothing! they charged me 394
00!!!  tried to get $2000
00 out of me
beware of this aamco!
they are very nice
they fixed my car in a few hours
it needed a few minor things fixed
good luck in life and hope business stays up
i have been coming here since april 2012
you can beat that
it reportedly kept failing the road test
on 3 or 9 or 15 - we finally got the car back
it appears to be running fine
hopefully all is well from here on out
i do not  know because i am  not a mechanic
i bring all my vehicles here
the staff is very pleasant as well
we have  been to this workshop twice
no charge  in and out
very helpful  friendly and professional!!
went back again and again
nothing! they charged me 394
00!!!  tried to get $2000
00 out of me
beware of this aamco!
this place is awesome
very fair with pricing for parts and labor
they get the job done and the quality shows
very happy i came to this shop
only one i go to now
i came back a second time and felt the same vibe
i took my truck into have the ac looked at
it had been blowing hot for a few weeks
i did the work myself
do not take your car here!
new aamco in the neighborhood
i would return in the future for more service!
staff is wonderful polite and very helpful
thank you so much for the recommendation!
generally  i am  a nice person
these guys are the best
bought a shell for my new truck first
thanks guys!
i have to say
great job to the entire team at tom
!sincerely a loyal and enthusiastic new customer
i was fortunate enough to get to work with brad
their selection is massive
these guys are really great
we are more than pleased with this firm
this enabled us to make a planned trip vs
waiting for the repair to be completed
the check  in the mail
as for my experience
great experience buying our t&g camper
they were not  high pressure easy to deal with
they seem to be very honest
i would definitely recommend them
awesome people  family business
must have patience here because they r very busy
quality lance trailers !
they sold me an absolute lemon
very frustrating
shop elsewhere first!
another issue we had with them
he told me would look into it and call me
have always received good service from them!
we were told they had sold it
we found the exact trailer on the lot
same vin number
they acted like they knew nothing about it
little deceptive in our opinion
would give zero if possible
update:    maybe i was a little harsh
toms honored the advertised price
we ended up buying from the surprise location
we are happy with the way everything worked out
which was greatly appreciated
camping there in early april was delightful
i would wholeheartedly recommend toms camperland
back to my experience with tom
he then asked for a $500 deposit
"this was ""the resolution"
that  what i ultimately ended up doing
give them a shot
i do not  see how they can be beat
our new f-150 looks great with it  a
shell and we love the quality
watch out for these guys
well  when i do it wo not  be here
i am  going to little dealer  little prices next
fingers crossed i get some help there
no service after the sale
i had to yell and threaten to get service
palamino campers are junk
i purchased a lance 2295  new
i spent 3+ hours doing a predelivery insp
i will  buy again from the boys
our buying experience was great
not so at tom
he kept it short and honest
everything was first class
we were sold with zack and the lance
so we knew it would be a long search
but they left you alone to browse
we bought a 2016 rpod
so far we love it and are glad we used them
but other than that i would use them again
their new location has gone to their head
my understanding was they had some to spare
he then proceeds to ask for the covers back
i returned the covers and left the store
we just purchased our second camper from tom
friendly and knowledgable service
no sales pressure
their new place on broadway and alma school rocks
i have mixed feelings about this dealership
thanks for the outstanding customer service
incredible
allan is wonderful to work with
get got a new lance camper and just love it
tom  camperland is a great place to get a camper
good price on the solar systems too by the way
on my pick up day i arrived at 2 p
m and allen took my truck over to their shop
while i was waiting i toured their inventory
we were greeted and made welcome immediately
we live in southern california
i bought a 2009 lance camper
prices are right
people drive from california to buy from tom
or fly in from other locations
need i say  more?
looks like it was installed at the jeep factory
excellent workmanship
they bend over backwards for you
my purchase demonstrates this fact
my jeep is rated at 3 500 lbs
so i needed something light weight
i saw the tab and the rpod
no problem
they switched the unit for me
no problem
they installed it
i realized my jeep could handle the rpod
once again
no problem
tons of rigs on the lot to inspect
great people from sale to service
sales people were nice and not overly pushy
most showers he ca not  even stand in
now the challenging part  money
if i* could give these guys more stars i would !
traveled from n
cal to pick up lance camper
service was great
highly recommended
could not have had a better experience or deal
thank you again
that is the short and sweet of it
there is no better way to put it
i was told it would take 2-3 weeks to come in
i have to say  the place is very nice
everyone is very helpful and pleasant
man do they ever look too small off the truck
could not  be more pleased
if i could add a pic of it i would
i highly recommend them
lots of choices and fun to look around
brad was great on the phone
that  was incredibly kind of him and tom
thanks to brad and the guys at tom;s
great guys and treat customers well
my topper is now in perfect condition
amenities seem nice
not so much
the amenities are amazing
high-five
very expensive
but  very clean
easy to fix
hope they read this
a major pain in the you know what
we rented from them
the delivery was 5 hours late
avoid these people and this company
look out for their drivers using company vehicles
very friendly and honest staff
helpful with battery selection
the smoke coming out of the back is horrible
this place is a rip off!!  consumer beware
it pulled left as well
all for a very reasonable price
highest marks! customer for life!
these guys have done a great job for us
all for a very reasonable price
bought our first airstream here from phil
phil did a great job for us
quick to respond and easy to get along with
ask for phil!!
long story short  we now have our dream trailer
stay away from this airstream dealer
they have earned business for life
their prices are incredible
very disappointing!
this is what a buying experience should be!
absolutely awful
we were not happy but felt we had no recourse
be forewarned
my sales rep bobby was really excellent
highly recommend!
just purchased a basecamp and i couldnt be happier
joseph and staff were awesome
thank you guys!
we had a good experience with the service dept
i agree with most of the reviews
the campground is not the greatest
i believe there was a pool also
this place a pretty nice
it have all you need for rv living
it  a 3 minute walk to the casino
the park is pretty hard for taxis to find
all in all a pretty nice stay
not bad  all things considered
it  vegas  so it  noisy and lit up all night
no more shuttle service offered from the rv park
this was an okay rv park to stop for an overnight
staff was not very accommodating
we were even willing to pay more
dog park was a joke
just very run down
will be trying the koa if ever back in vegas
rest rooms with showers
pretty cheap for an rv park on the strip
once online i had 40% packetloss
restrooms feel worn and dilapidated
pool closes at 7:30pm
i hope it has been fixed now
this is the worst rv park in vegas
the pool was closed and the hot tub drained
this park is completely mismanaged
too bad because this could have  a good park
easy walk to the casino
in the morning i checked the place out
would stay here again
where do i start
the laundry facilities were reasonable and clean
$2 for wash $1
75 for dryer
we love this place and look forward to returning
they knocked on our door or left notes
the location in general is what we miss the most
shower was nasty
this is for the rv park part of circus circus
first impression- no gate or security at night
and they do
which brings me to the next point
nope  they do not  have a concierge
do not  even bother with the wifi
it does not  work
they do not  have cable tv hook-up
for the price we paid  it was not  worth it
find another rv park in vegas
we wo not  be staying here again
so we move to a different spot
the bathrooms are outdated but clean
the pool was dirty and water cloudy
it really was just a parking lot with hookups
i would not stay here again
pros - it  a level parking lot with rv hookups
it  sort of on the strip
there was lots of space for the slideouts
open the pool
i wouldnt stay at this place if i lived in a tank
gotta love las vegas
larceny over $250 apparently is not a felony here
unbelievable
place has no security whatsoever
had 3 bikes stolen from me
worth over $2000
and security and metro do not care!!
everyone was very helpful
bathrooms were clean and it was an easy hookup
now i know and i will  just bring it myself
definitely will rent from el monte again!
we will definitely rent from them again
rented an rv for burning man
sure there was a little dirt
no problems with the $200 cleaning charge
the problem is the attitude
not very good customer service
"we rented a 22"" rv from el monte"
this was our first time renting from them
the rv was new  clean and everything worked
we will only go back to el monte
great service
the rv was clean and ready on time
returning it was a breeze
will definitely use them again
i have used this rv rental place a few times
every time we have had a great experience
i will be using them again!
we would definitely rent from them again
we had a great experience here
staff was very helpful for first time renters
last minute we were able to get one from el monte
stacey was super helpful and friendly
a great experience
highly recommend this location
rv was fine too  no issues on our trip
she had to receive a tetanus shot too
recently rented mh for trip to moab
we were shown one rv and rented a different one
in other words  if you leave it  they take it
so we know we packed them
which will take up to 60 days to follow up on
i will not go away that easily
will always go to el monte for all my rv needs
we waited
then waited some more
then we waited for
drum roll please
6 hours!!!!! let me spell that for you
i repeat  could not find our rv
you have been warned
this dealership is horrible
they do not  return calls
david and jake really took care of us
everything is working perfectly
kudos to them
i would highly recommend their service department
thanks again
no personality
watch out!
typical sales lot
what a joke!
this company is super customer service oriented
ask for sten  he is your guy
inventory is very complete
it is now february 2017
i would give zero stars if i could
the worst salesman ever
rude  condescending and a smart mouth
please do yourself a favor
do not get a trailer from them
stopped by today at 4:30  they close at 5
they all continued to give me totally wrong info
i know which one i think they are
as of today
the service writer said sure it  about $ 26
00    i was speechless!!!!!
mike  please bear with me while i rant
best regards rick c
another week has passed
but nothing!!
upset with them
bought a 2016 freedom elite in august
i have  read the reviews and i have to disagree
i had my rv serviced at the las vegas store
never upset
always showing concern
even when i rib em they still smile
thank you mike for everything you have done
i hope your there for a long time to come
horrible service
also wanted tires
the 1750 quote did not include tires
i would highly recommend going elsewhere
it was not  hidden
it took months to even get an appt
""" great motto for a place of business"
stay away!
we were leaving las vegas the next day
i was informed it would be an 8 hour job
my trailer was completed friday afternoon
i will be returning when i need work again
attention  they actually try to scam you
was driving for 3 months  nothing happened
was driving 10
000 miles  nothing  brakes are fine
these people have too much money to spend
what a waste of time
bought a thor class c on march 15th  2018
& weeks in shop to date
no updates are provided
we just purchased our second trailer from them
never once did we feel pressured into a sale
joe in finance was also great to work with
they  are liars
last saturday i was there to buy my father an rv
we had toby as a sales rep
i told it was not a good deal
he said make us an offer and i will try
in my head my math was $50 800
toby came back and shook my hand for the deal
the ran my card for $5000
00 and they set me up with finance on tuesday
i did not  want to let him down
watch these thieves
joe by the way you were way off
it  been a month
my first payment is due tomorrow
no one will answer my calls
still no call back
no email back
i still have no access to my rv
i have  document everything with pictures
if anyone can help
please send legal recommendations
i have  put in several complaints to corporate
contacted the bbb
not sure if there  anything else i can do
i am  currently seeking legal assistance
please do not  let these crooks steal from you
i have updated this review
thank goodness for them
was not  too impressed at first
went in and talked to phil  no help from him
started to leave and then talked josh
that was monday
he called yesterday   and no one answered
you think that their sh**does not  stink
they are all gone including mine
yes camping world did the repairs  every time
i got home still choking
like i said: missfits
his title should be the babble manager
please do not  follow my mistakes
john-john  oscar and denny refused to give up
these guys went above and beyond for us
a few bucks and a sincere thank you go a long way
mike is a nice kid but over his head
c all them every day
terrible  terrible  terrible
a few bucks and a sincere thank you go a long way
happy trails!
bought my first 5th wheel here
was very clear about my inexperience
"""oh well  you are  so independent"
"again ""well  i do not  doubt it"
chuckle chuckle
you are  so independent
""" wtf?!? i am  a 48yr old woman"
i dress myself too
again  my vagina does not detract from my brain
fed myself that day too
yes i would  like to sign the papers
i just paid you
it goes on like this
finally a week later i go in to do a walk through
they had been fixing some things
oscar is the best part of this whole scenario
so helpful
so informative
""" no shit sherlock"
they did nothing that was discussed
~ quoted me a very fair price for new tires
first off go to the henderson location
i went there because i had a $20
i looked at her in disbelief
so i bought them and a tire gauge
i used my $20
00 coupon and got in my car
so i guess i will be going back tomorrow
your choice!!
horrible service
also wanted tires
the 1750 quote did not include tires
we had to wait 3 weeks to get an appointment
we left the rig there
after another 3 weeks i got to pick it up
here  where i really get irritated
the lot man brought the rig  dropped it and left
i dropped it here for service & 3 warranty items
just more on their list of uselessness
i am sorry i bought it here
they have ruined the rv experience
i should have not left that review
we even tipped the jerks
when we went to pick it up  the wash was horrible
im sure it only took 20 to 30 minutes to do
the carpets were not shampooed as promised
the only thing that looked nice was the tires
everything else is bad
we are taking it in to get it properly washed
oh  kevin with camping world is a punk too
what a piece of crap this service is
go elsewhere!!!
the caulking looked like crap
guess we put up with it
10 months later the roof peeled again
repair department integrity does not exist
try the boulder camping world or someplace else
however hector could not  have treated us better
he informed us about everything
the repair was going to take 6 weeks
nice to be treated like you are so important
no problem taken care of no questions asked
what a refreshingly positive experience
if i ever buy another rv i am heading to vegas
thanks so much
thank you camping world
we appreciate your friendliness and attentiveness
wes assured us we could get the lower price
signing the paperwork was easy  too
"when we said  ""no thanks""  that was it"
too busy to dispense propane
too busy to help a traveler with a safety issue
a very disappointing experience at camping world
bought my first 5th wheel here
was very clear about my inexperience
"""oh well  you are  so independent"
"again ""well  i do not  doubt it"
chuckle chuckle
you are  so independent
""" wtf?!? i am  a 48yr old woman"
i dress myself too
again  my vagina does not detract from my brain
fed myself that day too
yes i would  like to sign the papers
i just paid you
it goes on like this
finally a week later i go in to do a walk through
they had been fixing some things
oscar is the best part of this whole scenario
so helpful
so informative
""" no shit sherlock"
they did nothing that was discussed
jim was awesome
came over with a cocktail
very nice! it  all good now
if i could i would give a zero
here is the email i sent to corp offices
00 travel trailer through camping world
00 and my mother and father deposit that day
00 deduction pending
i assumed it was the $300
00 deposit
he explained to me that no  this never happened
00 out when paul gottlieb enters
this is when the situation became explosive
at this point i wanted to walk away
i looked to steve takahashi for some help
would highly recommend him!
worst place ever
the service department is horrible
after buying a new 5th wheel here
the roof delaminated on the second trip
we made an appointment to bring it in
stay away from this place if you can
aug 31 2016
the fridge was broken and also checked off as ok
we love our new rv
they denied that also  they are  good at that
will definitely go back to this location
horrible service!  took 2
5 weeks just to get an appt
their part prices are totally unreasonable
i plan on avoiding this place forever
absolutely the worst customer service
went to buy a trailer
ok  let  put this issue to bed once and for all
would not recommend at all!!!
over staffed for an empty store
we bought are brand new trailer
that  horrible
we bought the trilwr a month ago
it should have been a priority
this was our first big camper
the area was clean and organized
they answered all our questions
it  now wednesday morning and no paperwork
i spoke to a finance manager  alfredo
bad  bad  bad!this place is awful
we have been rving for 5
we got it to the rv and it was broken
that was the first flag
terrible experience
not worth the drive from the airport area
better prices
i guess they did not  need our $90 000
fist off let me say this is my first yelp review
bison said that was fine
brad has zero customer service skills
what a joke of customer service at this dealer
tj gallina was our salesman
they have accommodated every one of our needs
happy trails!
these guys are a bunch of clowns
do not talk to an ignorant salesman
it went into the shop on the 29th
said they would clean it all up
when i went to get it   the wash job was pathetic
i do not  think ed likes his job or people
i would avoid this dealer
thanks all!
go for the selection  then purchase it elsewhere
thank you joe and mike in the service department
sounds fair
i get busy  i have seen busy in many places
but rude is not necessary
we asked how to go to the service section
"not my department"""
so we left
good thing nothing needs to be done today
our salesman robert dustin was great
he greeted us asking if we had questions
we closed the deal
ca not  forget kay at the front desk
very nice lady
what follows is why i gave a 5 star rating
when we arrived nothing was done and i was upset
i also have to mention josh
joe glazier
one word: crooks!their only one purpose: sales
lies  lies lies
they are  better than you
and you are  sh#t to them
you will find anything better on rvtrader
see hector
he saves vacations
thank you hector and kevin
this is the worst experience i have had anywhere
my next call will be to their corporate offices
john was very courteous and helpful
he helped in getting my trailer in to be repaired
what a joke
we have had our rv since march
we got to las vegas
the basically laughed at us
we are not offering you anything
it was a piece of hunt
when i said today i should call your bishop
i was so discussed with him and his integrity
i got an auto response
i emailed them
still no trailer  still no response
they do not  care
i am  back with another 5 star review
josh gray
outstanding service
extremely upbeat
willing to work hard to make the purchase happen
well done
he was a rv tech prior to sales and it shows
waste of money & time
been waiting for30 mins to speak to manager
they broke stuff like the stove
the places it sucks
dont use it this business for anything
we stood and politely said we would be leaving
i am the other half of ford  comment
we are making payments on  unit we cannot use
get your shit together and get my rv done
warranty work is never quick or easy
that was a hard fact to learn with our first rv
he kept us in the loop on repair status
thanks mike!
"the sales guy we had "" chris k"
it was not
so that tells us they just opened the box
well it  been 3 weeks so far and no decals
this saga goes on
and i will update and make changes if i am  wrong
until then
a very knowledgeable and helpful person
i will call them every time to service our coach
thank you johnny
i forgot to get the guys name
we will continue to use american motor lube
i am a retired building inspector and contractor
just used these guys for my oil change
the service only took about 20 minutes
the mechanic was very professional and helpful
the price is not  bad either
i would definitely recommend them to anyone
i will be using them for all of my oil changes
i was very pleased with both services
will absolutely refer to anyone who asks
i bit and dropped $150
it ran for a total of 45 minutes
no true solution was offered by the owner
i will not be back
my father needed a part for his tractor
they were so incredibly helpful
great on time service
would recommend for any of your rv needs
they sell propane at a reasonable price
employees very courteous and friendly
full service supply store
keep up the great work
thanks russ keep up the hard work
i have been to this location many times
steve smith was awesome
he sold me two awesome generators
i go back to this location because of steve
thank you steve
oh yeah  his assistant william was helpful too
a definite recommend! thank you!!!
stopped in this weekend to look at toy haulers
he really just did not  want to help us
he basically tried to get rid of us asap
we used a cooler with ice for most things
"this motorhome was not ""new"" it was ""used"""
we brought our horse trailer here to be repaired
took 4 weeks to replace the ac unit
i took it back for a slide out issue
after 4 weeks still no parts and still no repair
i am  told it will be 2 more weeks
i would not buy a stick of gum from them
i am amazed that they are still in business
avoid this dealer
i have no idea how they stay in business
customer service is awful
while that one was enroute the other one broke
it was loud but not consistent
while in california it was horrible
like 7 hours away
it broke off
the new one fits fine
they had not  fixed the generator at all
he replaced a servo motor
there were not  any
he did not  offer to reimburse me for them
the new unit only lasted a month
but it did still blame me for things
***do not buy from toms camperland
no charge
my response to the owners reply is simple
the service department here is great
each site has full hook ups
no wi-fi was offered to us
mostly families and older folks
no party rvs
the registration office closes at 7:30 pm
the pool was filthy
bathroom was old but clean
for one night  it was just right
finally drove to the front office
it looked like an out building
the oasis was a much better choice
the rv was very clean and well kept
customer service was excellent
pick up and drop off went very smooth
i felt that was a little ridiculous
i will definitely rent from here again
they were very professional
we plan on renting again from el monte
i rented from el monte on s
las vegas blvd
and had a wonderful experience
no complaints from me  i highly recommend
will use them again
rented rv  from them for many years
see you again soon
these people are crooks
it  been a month
my first payment is due tomorrow
no one will answer my calls
still no call back
no email back
i still have no access to my rv
i have  put in several complaints to corporate
contacted the bbb
not sure if there  anything else i can do
i am  currently seeking legal assistance
please do not  let these crooks steal from you
update : 7 or 24 or 2018
they hit my fence while delivering the 5th wheel
mike hulsi promised he would  get it sorted out
changed his mind on that
said he  done enough
he wo not  call me back about it
now i have to go through the legal process
now there  no bathroom door
my mom has to use the bathroom with no door
we are  about 2 months in
this is terrible
it  been a nightmare
please steer clear of this establishment
the will be out of business soon
i have been calling for three   days!!!
bought a new 2019 thor freedom elite
walk around was a joke
receptionist is rude on the phone and in person
appears put out when asked a question
warranty service is a joke
given an appointment for 9:30 a
show up and you might as well be invisible
no effort to speak to us or advise us of delay
driver dropped off the coach  then disappeared
no explanation what so ever
i will be as concise and direct as possible
expert nothing but that!https: or  or youtu
be or 6wrsmu7wmuq
they have very terrible service
the door could not be unlocked
what a huge disappointment
i told mr
i told forklift operator to look what he just did
i had him call mr
flores  his boss
i sent scathing email to mr
lenois  camping world ceo complaining about mr
flores and his forklift operator
robinson  delivering my new generator mr
a hundred & fifty less than what i paid
even their regional mgr mr
robinson  said absolutely no also
i was not  bothering anybody at all
the cops banged on my door at 4:00am
great repair department
please resolve this
this is our 1st time staying here
overall this is a very nice upscale rv park!
it is close to a jet fighter facility
""" it  the sound of freedom!"""
course and the people who run it are a joke
never been so digusted with service
the lady who runs it is beyond rude
my round was only 3
serves them right being next to a trailer park
there are loads of tables and booths in the club
the food was good enough
nothing special
you also get a cup of coleslaw
the coleslaw was very bland though
hopefully the service will improve soon!
the wi-fi   is very efficient
we will return when in the area
1 is a bonus!
everything was clean and well maintained
participated in a pickleball tournament here
they have 16 outdoor courts in all
other than that  it  a winner
very nice and friendly
they were fine with it just curious
tee times should be 10-11min
the course is in great shape
staff very very friendly
very overpriced and under managed
you may require extra hoses for water and sewer
it is luke air force base
plus you cannot have any bags outside period
other than that the park is nice!
i will not play this course again
the greens are terrible and fairways are weedy
the concierges we awesome though
same thing  did not  want to answer any questions
#locallove
took my maternity photos here
all of my photos ended up being beautiful
small sheltered picnic table filled park
saw a gate opening for a maricopa trail
we turned back
they do not  sell them on site
this is an amazing spot for any outdoor activities
bummer  i would have bought it from them today
i will say the lady was very nice
i am very thankful i found this shop
they also do performance upgrades to your liking
we are  past 2 weeks now
will update
over the past year i have had them work on my 7
my initial problem was an extreme lack of power
on his advice we did this work
i do not recommend using bullseye diesel doctor
they have  had my truck for over a week
i have  been getting the runaround since
now they are  not taking my calls
totally unsatisfactory
will update this review if or when it  resolved
i said fine
after 2 weeks they had not  touched the truck
i told them i would  need it soon
$400 for the repair
-$797 spent and the vehicle still was not fixed
we have been coming here for years
great place for youngsters and oldsters
always have lots of activities
i have an older camper myself
you will  thank me
not sure what candace is talking about
this is a great place for kids
sounds like a family place to me
night time is for fires and drinks
set up tents and party
rarely does anything get out of hand
my family has had a permanent site here for 30yrs
never had even an argument with another regular
a great day trip to escape the city!
c'est l'automne
le parc est magnifique
quelques marcheurs croisés seulement
une grande bouffée d'air dans un parc immense
personnel accueillant et chaleureux
seul hic: le prix d'entrée  surprenant et élevé
also  do not  forget your bathing suit! :)
un joyau dans un écrin de verdure
each site has a fire pit and picnic table
the trail leads through a forested area out to
wait for it
very beautiful park near the oka cheese factory
nice amenities and a pretty lake
they have wifi there - which is kinda a bummer
this shop is one in a million
i thank my lucky stars  all 5 of them
brought my nissan murano in for service
we swapped out a dying battery
they did not reset the clock
which they did not do
if you have a diesel this is the shop for service
super honest and straight forward
would for sure come back again
everyone was very nice and pleasant
the staff was friendly
the owner  father was great
he came out and greeted my daughter and i
he was a joy to talk to
i was never pressured to get work done
the mechanic was very up front about my problem
this is a place i will take my car to again
elite totally lives up to their name
well we could not be more thrilled with our find
no over selling of what was needed to be done
outstanding job elite!!! keep up the great work!
these guys are awesome
friendly and knowledgeable
highly recommended
i wouldnt take my cars anywhere else
i would definitely come back again!
love the people and service here
the owner rob is knowledgeable and friendly
thanks guys so being so great
went in for the first time for an oil change
honest and dependable shop
found this place here on yelp  so glad i did
will never go elsewhere when it  this good!
these guys are great
i will be back! update
waiting area is nice  cable tv and soft couches
highly recommended
the shop is a little hidden
thanks elite automotive for treating us right
these guys are great
i will be back!
what else can i say i will see you next time rob
so that was a nice little surprise today as well
and they took it on graciously and gladly
and they solved the problem
and in under an hour
great service and great work
highly recommended!
so i made an appointment for that friday
so i was a little startled
"couldn""t find it  long story short"
ripoff scam!
i was very impressed with the business
thanks elite!
and will not oversell you
bryce was awesome
this place is great  very helpful and friendly
the front office lady was very nice and helpful
i was very pleased with the service and pricing
excellent waiting area nice facility
i was very  pleased with service
treated like a family member
friendly great prices service location
very honest people
i am  new to owning an r
i called r
complete and explained our situation
here  the best part
i was only getting low on gas
i did not  know it will  shut down if low on gas
it gets better
these are some awesome folks
we took our 40 ft
motorhome in to be painted
after 6 weeks  we were told it was done
i will not be using their services again
i was told to ask for mike  and i am  glad i did
he was quick and thorough
my first in-shop visit for a number of repairs
the staff is real nice to work with
they did an excellent job
we also asked him to check our roof
horrible  dishonest  and extremely misleading
my name is jake boyer
i am the owner of gilbert poolman llc
everything was picture perfect like it always is
now fast forward to the recent past
so i immediately check all my gauges
wow!!  wow!!  not again with these clowns
which i received 24 hours later
not good news
guess what
my radiator is now damaged some how
these people are gangsters
josh runs a great shop
priceless!
awesome place
brought our old jeep here
i will  update the review then
the pickup and delivery is nice as well
then they fixed my jeep with a simple fix
plus chris  service was great
great job serious!
by far the best mechanic shop in the entire valley
they really go the extra mile
best service i have  had in a long time
thoroughly pleased with the work done at serious
on top of that  best labor rates in town
i really appreciate that
great service
very friendly staff from the start
outstanding repairs
took some time and i am  glad it did
thank you!
great place and great people
get my car back like brand new
alfonso  you rock!
i will never bring my car back there again
my insurance referred me to this place
took my car someplace else for repair
each time they exceed my expectations
great  friendly customer service
very accomodating with schedules and times
best of all
very professional staff
last time we were here was 2 years ago
it stinks
sewer?  that  what it smells like
side by side rigs
very close
heavy traffic noises  frequent sirens
"""  uh huh"
95--that signal was very strong
double ugh
and cable tv is fuzzy
we have  had one clear channel
the office staff was average on friendliness
it was okayfor a parking lot campground
nice people
not paved or graveled
dogs got bad burs in their hair
laundry room was well kept
couple of pools and laundry facilities
posted 5mph
i received a email message from a david m
""" what in the hell does that mean exactly?"
this campground is fine  but not great
we had to pay extra for a pull-through space
"""  otherwise  clean restrooms and pool area"
nice park and quiet
just some office things to fix
we are not fans of koa
we had to walk to a casino to get change
i did not notice a playground here either
i do not  understand all of the negative reviews
we would definitely return to this park
00 a night
we stay here often
the pool area looked nice and well kept
i would stay here again
rates are an ok price for all they have to offer
stayed here for 2 nights
the shop in the office barely had anything in it
there was no bench and nothing to put my stuff on
there  only one spot for free wi-fi
just sayin
relatively clean but noisy
major trafdic  cars racing  sirens all night
basically a parking lot with a few amenities
warm  but not hot jacuzzi
constant helicopter traffic
would not  stay here again
80 % of washers and dryers out of order
staff is awesome and very friendly
we paid approximately $50 per night for the site
most did not have that kind of tree
way too close
i doubt if we would stay here again
and room to breathe!
stopped in to make long term reservations
informed the staff   of our requirements
we were assigned a space
would have been nice to know that up front
i would not  have paid when i did
your rig may not fit when you do get there
stayed here for 2 nights
the shop in the office barely had anything in it
there was no bench and nothing to put my stuff on
i left very upset and very disappointed
just sayin
great place to rv  feet away from the casino floor
i will  be back in july!
i would definitely stay here again!
right next door to sam  town casino
very nice and friendly registration agents
nice restrooms and showers
they have a pool and hot tub
two dog runs
mostly pull-thru sites with space for slide-outs
nice spot if visiting the las vegas area
crowded is the first thing that comes to mind
this is like a parking lot for rv
this place is not  worth even one star
very old facility which has not been updated
water in shower was often not hot
everything was clean  just old and shabby
11-13-2014
not bad of a campground given the location
lots of options around you for entertainment
otherwise  this place was decent enough
i would defiantly stay here!
it was our first time camping in a 24-ft trailer
madelyn and ed were especially helpful
it  close to the casino and hotel and seemed nice
the problem is security
i did not  really think too much of it
by this time i was in tears
they were not able to find it though
it is for the security of the park
it also has a nellis side
we prefer boulder
reluctant to leave once again
our 4th year and 7th stay
lovely meandering streets
spacious sites
easy to access
free shuttles to the strip or fremont street
koa staff here are seriously terrific
they gladly help you plan and do stuff
and are pleasant and helpful
lovely pool and hot tub and bathing options
a happy place for us and terrifically convenient
a true respite and enclave
we intend to stay even longer next season
perhaps sooner
stayed here before it was a koa
we will not be staying here again
just terrible
which they knew about
a phone call would be nice
just a few algebra ii work sheets
someone should open another one
maybe up north more close to mount charleston
terrible! terrible! terrible
this is a really nice park next to sams town
the pet areas are great
bathrooms and showers conveniently located
wonderful swim area
close to downtown
nice restaurant choices at the casino next door
great dog park
nice staff and good security
spaces are pretty tight
nice pool
all in all a good vegas stop
i will return
i stayed in this hotel at the end of feb
i went for a wresting event
which was no big deal
i loved the hotel
stayed here for a few days
personally nothing to set the world on fire
thank you  no  never again
this is a koa
in that regard  it is perfect
the facilities are well maintained
there are two dog parks
ok  so here  the deal
you can get a buy 3 days and get a day for free
am i wrong? what a deal
clean bathrooms and friendly people
very friendly
this is a hidden gem
nice buffet
not great but pretty good
the huge atrium and laser or  water show
why four stars? a strip tip and a serious tip
it  not luxurious
bare bones
much better to save your money
strip tip
they provide a great shuttle bus to the strip
it runs all day to harrahs and downtown
free and you do not  have to take uber
safety tip
do not  go to or park at the walmart at night
homeless people  drunks  drugs etc
no problems during the day
i have gone at night but my wife was nervous
i have  never been worried at the koa
great place to stay!
this place deserves a - 5 stars
this ass said i needed a column rebuild
charged about $500 for this mess
the parking lot i had abandoned it in
complained to the state of nevada about this crook
got a letter back and did not  follow up
but yeah this guy is a total crook
i should have known to leave then and there
did not  have cell phones in those days
brought in a nissan truck
can you fix cars or not???  is that my fault?
finally after over a month
"i took it back had it fixed no charge ""yay"""
i drove the truck for one month
and then the engine locked up completely
i brought it back and they refused to look at it
when i got rid of it
and when he glued my engine back together
this was in 1998
91 gray nissan pickup
do not bring your car here
a minor repair turns into weeks and months
from where mars
he takes your money and sits on your vehicle
what a liar
what a thief
i wish i could give zero stars
took my 2008 explorer for transmission repair
causing me to destroy my transmission
same location though
i own an older motorhome
it needs a lot of work
why!!!!! they will give you the run around
do not  do business with them
no stars not even 1
thank you
i preferred just to hang out outside myself
rears cambered slightly on the insides
eventually i will find another alignment shop
thanks dave and big a brake
you guys kick ass!
chris is great and has  customer service
in my opinion these guys are the very best
a very friendly and helpful atmosphere
nice job guys!
they have fixed both of our cars
if you need your car fixed this is the place to go
would highly recommend
thank you champs!
took my 02 ford f250 in with oil leak
was told hpop lines had to be replaced
proceeded to have repairs done
ford dealer charged me well over $1000
cost me alot to do business with these guys
my advice  stay far away if you own a diesel
i would not  trust them with my lawn mower
champs has been working on our rv for years
i recommend them to all my friends
not at all the fault of bucar  in any way
class act all around
more specifically ask for scott graham!
what a great experience had at this dealer
every team member was happy and eager to help us
will be back again forsure
highly recommended for rv service
it was a 3-4h rental  by the way
that  deceiving and that  why i am  upset about
stay away from this store
they are  not honest at all
write a list of what you want done
write it down
test drive the vehicle yourself before you leave
nice people  good prices  not detail-oriented
1 star is way too much for this place
will definitely never come back
i am  never renting from uhaul again
out of disgust  i just left
he  an honest and fair rv mechanic
highly recommend monte !
buyer beware i guess
00 for the rv  $393
00 in required rv insurance  and $150
all of our food spoiled! we lost over $150
00 of food
we were told to begin the dispute process
12 volts just like it should be
you do not  get better than that
i hope good carma follows this guy
thank you tom!william hulet us navy retired
no call back for days
ok benefit of the doubt
then never heard from them again
took the coach to johnny walker for repairs
that was the last we heard from him
great way to do business
i have told everyone not to bother with tnt
0 stars is what they should get
we had our air conditioner in the trailer act up
they quoted outrageous prices just to come out
i would recommend him any day!!
he has great business ethic
i would highly recommend tnt mobile services
had a great time with the boat in lake mead
angie was wonderful
their boat was excellent
she is awesome
will come back in the future
extremely accommodating and kind
top notch equipment and service
looking forward to rent from here again
amazing rv  amazing owner
rafts and tubes
so much fun
allie was a great guide
very knowledgable and friendly
a fun experience for the whole family
not sure he would agree
half day was perfect for us beginners
had so much fun
easy and fast to rent tubes and ride the bus down
friendly atmosphere
bring rope to tie tubes together
thanks for a fantastic adventure!
we travelled to the canyon from phx in two cars
long story short
the other car   got lost
all of the guides are helpful & friendly
i ca not  wait to go back next year
absolutely awesome trip
he was completely fun and safe
but  i would have liked to have the disc
she was really knowledgeable and a lot of fun
great experience for kids and adults
lunch was delicious
no phone  no nothing
thank you for our best rafting trip yet!
i took a kayak down the salt with my family
this is a great place for an adventure
do not shop anywhere else
he is also just a phone call away
he walked me thru it on the phone
good stuff
they rock over there
thanks mike
do not  waste your time or money with this company
they bait a switch on craigslist
look them up on ripoff
go any where else but there!!!
come here first!
too expensive for zero amenities
fits long rigs but it  a tight fit getting parked
water pressure is high  use a regulator
power never went out or anything
prices are reasonable and moreso long-term
hope to start again someday!
for what it is  the rv park is nice
they have long term residents and it  no frills
no activities  no pool  no clubhouse  etc
great place
cool digs!
it was a one stop shop
the guys there were nice enough  but
they took us to a lot down the road
let us take our time and look around on our own
everything was pretty nasty
then took us back to a lot were we started
there were better rvs there
we found one we liked
and wanted to buy it
a 2006 5th wheel
i was so embarrassed
and that he would send me a new one
the bank did not  care
the rv was only worth $16 000 top
make sure you read your contract entirely!!
it was a one stop shop
we bought our rv here and had a great experience
they took their time and answered each one
i did not feel pressured or rushed
we could not be happier with it
thank you!
this is the best camping world we have been in
we have had work done and purchased products
everyone is knowledgeable and friendly
much needed in this business
south boulder highway location
i do not recommend this camping world to anyone
in all fairness  i need to write a follow-up
too bad cw management never reached out to me
cw henderson is only a mile from my house
customer service is priceless
i came here looking for a face sun guard
i do not  think i will  be back
this location is like most other camping worlds
they have a store as well as a service shop
we stopped in a couple of times to shop
the staff was friendly and helpful
appalling customer service
this place is a waste of time
ok so i did that
then charged me about $20
00 just for air
this is not going to be a good review
the estimated time of repair was 9 weeks
very poor communication from alex arias
i checked reviews and true to form they were poor
poor customer service both in the shop and retail
they were not  having any of it so i left
he has me go in and confirm the unit is working
i am  thinking sign something and on my way
i get to the rig and hop in
the generator is still running and a or c is on
again whatever
i shut everything down and check everything out
now everything is working as it should
good customer service is such an easy thing
much easier than being at odds with a customer
i marvel at how often it  lacking
very unhappy with their pr
his response was if i brought him a printed copy
i must say this time we had some items we needed
i would return and recommend this store
there was no coffee or bottled water to be had
they could be dedicated to service and not sales
but there  no excuse for poor customer service
their service is fast and efficient
highly recommended!
i purchased a 13
after 3 days i had problems with both recievers
unprofessional  and snobbish
this camping world is way out on boulder highway
the other one we have  been to was in california
all camping world  are about the same
prices are steep for certain items
you must be a member to get that price
we are members
so  the employees were pretty much useless here
i did not  find the actual store to be bad
at this camping world
i had the pleasure of speaking with tony gigs
did not try to over sell me
showed us around
super super super great experience
the store itself is clean and well stocked
that  it on the good stuff
a and have gone to many different camping worlds
no thanks have a nice day  or anything
well at least cw is consistent
"manager to me; ""sorry""  spins  and walks away"
the cashier just shrugged as i walked out
good sam segregated based on age
offgridoutlaws
not sure why the low stars from these other people
he went out of the way to answer all my questions
raphael was the the service tech
highly recommended!!!
that was six weeks ago and counting
i know what your thinking
why did not  i get in my truck and leave
? because i liked the guy and i took a chance
that is why i very rarely go to the store
wo not  happen again
these folks were okay
i took my camper in to get an axle replaced
so  i started dealing with them myself
no  i replied
she said it was gone
pretty minor really
i bought the camper from camping world
i will not be purchasing my next one there
now my wife told me she no longer wants to camp
i love to camp
in fact  the store was vacant of customers
"the answer was  ""we do not  do that here"
""" - very bluntly"
"answer  ""we do not  carry propane"
""" no useful information and no helpful advice"
we highly recommend
gave me a quote over the phone for a simple repair
said they entered the info wrong over the phone
total bait and switch
left to get service elsewhere
complete waste of time
i change a bulb and still nothing
no let  take a look  nothing
stay away from camping world las vegas
took longer than expected
500$ more
we refused
we paid 500 $ for the check up and new battery
what a crock
right brake light and directional do not  work
awning we had replaced does not  work well
toothpaste still in sink from last owners
i paid off the financing 1 week later
no points for you little scammers
buyer beware here  especially on used trailers
i will think twice before buying from them again
i wouldnt recommend
not real pleased
i wish i could give a minus on the stars
i bought a used rv from them last year
i paid $5500
i have put nearly $4000
00 to get it in condition to go anyplace
i know i cannot get back what i have  put into it
just to let some money grabbing jerk take it
lied to again and the camper still is not  done
wow just when you think it ca not  get worse
do not shop or buy from this company
ridiculous
i would not recommend little dealer to anyone
then there were several punch list items
two big ones
we made an apt to bring our trailer in
what was the purpose of the appointment
this place is a joke
service department was great
saved my vacation!
too bad cuz they are  so close to me
allie in the service department is awesome
jeff marsh
had work done at shop by gary
this place is a mess
it was leaking again by the time i got it home
do yourself a favor and go anywhere   else
we ended up buy a 2016 forest river vengeance
the salesman we dealt with was ronnie dye
ronnie was not pushy  but like a friend
there was no pressure from his side
points out the water hookups
he pointed to my black water clean hookup
he finally figures out the fresh water hookup
it does not end there
so we get the rv home and i hook it all up
fine!!!  next the hot water heater does not work
the sad part is  it still does not work
which could take a couple of days
we like it and wish our hot water heater worked
this review pertains to the service department
they have received several complaints about him
nobody else should have to suffer through this
it should be done next week   9 or 19 or 15
just make your life easier and go somewhere else
it was replaced within a few days
what a waste of time!
took my camper here for some warranty work
looked like there is a good selection to look at
made arrangements to see the motorhomes on day 3
little dealer fixed the awning its back home
how funny i guess they do not  look at yelp
have learned a hard lesson on this one
shame on you little dealer
no one knows what is  going on
great selection and good prices
they gave me the run around
00 diagnosis charge that we were originally quoted
we walked in and were told to have a look around
no salesperson escorted us
did not  think anything of it
but when we were ready to leave
thank you sheryl for picking up a dropped ball
bait and switch
advertised a 6x10 cargo trailer for $1 821
00 on their website
told me they are $2 100
yes  that is right
it is unbelievable they are still in business
ordered another which took another month to get
i wondered what they said about me when i left
online the msrp was listed at 8750
so i naturally thought gary had made a mistake
ha! amazing
it just got more expensive
this place is shady
i would stay away
must be a relative
hint ldlp hire experienced service people
just do not
typical shady sales tactics
this was on a friday
should have read reviews first
unbelievable
stay away from these guys!!!
that is well deserved
surprise surprise
really busy
but you know you can take it wherever you want
i will not be treated like this
and take it sitting down
stay far far away from this rip off of a company
they are only interested in taking your money
there is no customer service here
owner does not return calls
so sorry i ever walked into the place
com and cautiously went to visit
no buyers remorse to speak of
they are  a bunch of crooks
stay away
they then would not correct the error
i ended up losing 8 k selling that camper
stay clear
still not an employee or salesperson in sight
i should have believed all the bad reviews
they seemed welcoming
however every camper was locked
nobody was willing to help
there were 6 people lounging around doing nothing
guess they do not  want to sell anything
i highly recommend this place
please see review for that dealership
we recently purchased a grand design 354 rv
he knew of our situation and kept up on it
the gentleman came out and repaired our rv
thank you!!!
not having much choice  i complied
walked in at 1:37 this afternoon
very disappointed
ldlp is a horribly run company
all in all a satisfying experience
would recommend an would return in future
ok  i took it back as i had a issue with my lift
00 but they wanted 550
maybe its just me
they could careless about their word
our family has used them for 5 units
a very disappointed long time consumer
thinking about updating my trailer
this experience is still fresh on my mind
they were negative for the most part
i said i would give them a shot anyway
my family had along history of using them
i thought they would take care of me
this is for all of you
read other posts as well
i am not an isolated experience
"mike supplied "" it  posted down by your knees"""
there are sooooo many more options in arizona
please do not  go!!!
was told to bring in on 1 or 9 or 16
so we called spoke with melissa r
we did not receive that part of paperwork
rude behavior was running wield around that pllace
we again would here within the week from her
alot of buck shuffling going on here
stay tuned
they need a zero star
i would not  bring anything in there for service
terrible customer service
00 wheel bearing re-pack and brake inspection
i am not going to specify people in this review
while i first called in  the service dept
was friendly and helpful
i was quotes around 210
00ish which included the 99
00 form the repak and inspection
the very happy to do this and their tech came out
the quote was for an additional 260
00 to fix all that was wrong
they did reduce the bil to a little over 200
i am posting this to give kudos to chris
do not have his last name
thanks for the great job chris
and pat d
we traveled to mi and popped it up there
the fold up table was bent
one of the step bolts was missing
they fixed  or tried to fix most of the issues
we did not  use it again until recently
we paid and are still paying for this thing
it needs to be fixed correctly!! or replaced
i am currently in mi not far from in
ldlp is useless
i would definitely recommend them
it was a very bazaar situation
the lady kind of gave me the creeps
the second time was a few months later
a young girl helped us
making sharp turns every chance she had
again  a very strange transaction
so  start over
big problem  it still leaked
main st in mesa 480-649-4466
not happy at all with little dealer in mesa
now that is over
sales experience: it went reasonably well
i had my own financing which made it easier
we wrote a check for the down payment
we felt the walk through was rushed
called again
finally got things worked out and picked up the rv
since then  not so much
3 times  they never called back
the service personnel are also a bit out of sorts
had to call them for a part i needed
he took all my information for the part i needed
called me an hour later to clarify the part
never heard from him again
this was a month ago
nothing has changed here
nothing in our trailer worked
the heater  the fridge  water pump  nothing
we dropped it off at ldlp on the way home
back to little dealer
they say a cable is broken
estimate: $300
shame on you ldlp
we will not be back!
we do not  have anywhere to store it at this time
i normally hate dealers and dealerships
car dealers  rv dealers  does not  matter
we were blown away by the quality of it
it was really too good to be true
a truly enjoyable experience
thank you power rv!
horrible experience!!!!!!!
a no class seller
i said well lets look at the other coach
what i saw did not resemble the online pictures
it was nasty and had a terrible odor
i left after 10 minutes total on their lot
drove another 2 hours back home
i wo not  be back  you should not  either
too many good and professional sellers out there
right there when we needed them
professional to say the least
our refrigerator was on the fritz
we are due to depart phoenix on the next day
came out after a long day  and worked on it
it now works and cooling fine
we are fine to get on the road
many compliments are given to bullseye rv repair
they do not  cut corners
i was wrong
i know who to call for all my future rv repairs
he made me a happy camper!
polite and took time to answer my questions
thank you larry  a+ service
spent several thousands of dollars with larry
after service it would not start using diesel
he came out again
stated it was fixed
no returned calls or emails?? jerk
he never had a problem taking all my money before
would not tell anyone to ever use him again!!!
i have always felt that i got my money  worth
both men worked hard  and efficiently
their charges were reasonable and fair
they book me an appointment
they identified 3 problems
fixed all 3 problems
could not  be more satisfied
father and son team
i was honestly surprised
really good experience
larry with bullseye is a man of his word
we had used him several times before
he came out and measured for the slide toppers
he texted that evening with a price
thank you larry for a job well done
he is a thief!  please use someone else!
terrible service and attitude
he was paid in full and i even bought them lunch
so i have mailed it to him
we will see how honest bullseye truly is
buyer beware
i was right
he never responded after sending the invoices
slow  sloppy and rude
that  larry with bullseye rv repair
he did come out and fix one of his leaky mistakes
ill give him that
great experience  great staff and superb equipment
the actual trailer we rented was a toy hauler
it was in great shape and ready to go for us
the return was smooth and convenient as well
